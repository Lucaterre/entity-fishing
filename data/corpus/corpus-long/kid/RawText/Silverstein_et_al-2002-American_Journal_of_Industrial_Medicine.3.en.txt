Overall incidence and direct cost

State fund. There were almost 400,000 State Fund accepted non-traumatic soft-tissue (NTST) MSDs costing $2.6 billion in 1998 dollars, and more than 20 million lost workdays; these represent 26.4% of all State Fund accepted claimsMore than 36% of the NTST-MSD claims were compensable (lost time), compared to 23.5% of all other claims. The overall claims incidence rate (CIR) was 352 per 10,000 FTEs for all NTST-MSDs and 129 per 10,000 for compensable claims. The CIRs for all claims, all musculoskeletal claims, and all NTST-MSDs have decreased signi®cantly between 1990±1997However, the rate of decrease was less for the musculoskeletal claims (P < 0.01) than for all non-musculoskeletal claims and the rate for the NTST-MSD claims was less than for all other claims including musculoskeletal disorders of traumatic origin (P  0.05), approximately 5.0% per year for compensable claims. The severity rate for NTST-MSDs represented 47% of all claims' lost workdays. The severity rate for compensable NTSTMSDs decreased about 10.6% per year between 1992±1997

Occurrence and Direct Cost of Non-Traumatic Soft-Tissue Disorders by Body Region

Descriptive statistics for neck (CIR  40.1), back (CIR  191.6), and upper extremity (CIR  116.1), NTSTMSD accepted claims is presented inSciatica was identi®ed infrequently (CIR of 4.9 per 10,000 FTEs), but was extremely costly, averaging $46,553 (median of $17,669) per claim. Almost 80% were compensable. The CIR has not signi®cantly changed over the previous 8 yearsThe majority of the upper extremity NTST-MSDs were in the hand/wrist area, followed by the shoulder and then the elbow/forearm area. The shoulder and hand NTSTMSD claims resulted in more lost time and higher direct costs than the elbow/forearm area NTST-MSDsUnlike the back and neck, upper extremity NTST-MSD CIRs did not decrease signi®cantly over the yearsThere was no signi®cant decrease in CIR for either shoulder or elbow/forearm NTST-MSDs. While hand/wrist NTSTMSD claims decreased signi®cantly over time, they decreased signi®cantly less than the rate for all other claims excluding NTST-MSD claims (P < 0.001).

We selected several speci®c upper extremity diagnoses for closer examination, rotator cuff syndrome (CIR  15.3), epicondylitis (CIR  10.7), and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (CIR  24.3). The median age for CTS claimants was 37 compared to 39 for rotator cuff and 40 for epicondylitis claimants.

A much higher percentage of CTS claimants were females (60.9%) than were rotator cuff syndrome (36.8%) or epicondylitis (44.6%) claimants. Claims incidence rates for rotator cuff syndrome did not change over time, whereas the rate for epicondylitis increased (P < 0.05) and the rate for

CTS decreased (P < 0.01) signi®cantly. However the rate for CTS decreased statistically signi®cantly less than for all claims excluding NTST-MSDs (P < 0.001),The percent of CTS cases resulting in surgical release has decreased steadily (2.7% per year) between 1990 (47.1%) and 1997 (38.2%).

Self-insured

There were 2,541 compensable (lost time) neck NTST disorders, averaging 282 compensable claims per year, with a claims incidence rate of 5.1 per 10,000 FTEs. There were 42,592 back compensable NTST-MSD claims with a CIR of 85.9 per 10,000 FTEs. As with State Fund claimants, a higher proportion of NTST neck claims were among women (55±57%) than NTST back claims (42%) while age was basically the same (median of 37±38).

There were 26,812 compensable upper extremity NTST-MSD claims between 1990±1998 averaging 2,979 compensable claims per year (CIR  56.2 per 10,000 FTEs). Hand/wrist NTST disorders accounted for almost half of these, averaging 1,380 claims per year. The compensable CIR was 25.7 per 10,000 FTEs. CIRS for compensable NTST-MSDs of the shoulder and elbow were 18.2 and 5.7, respectively. As with the State Fund claims, approximately 60% of the hand/wrist NTST-MSD claimants were women, compared to 46% for shoulder and elbow/ forearm NTST-MSD claims. Claimants were slightly older compared to the State Fund claimants (39±40 years).

Distribution of NTST-MSDs by Industry

The workers compensation data were examined by industry sector, and by Washington's speci®c industrial risk classi®cations (WIC) that are based on more similar risk factors for injury than commercial considerations (SIC). The analysis evaluated both the magnitude (number or count) of claims and the risk (incidence) of claims. The ranks of these two components were averaged into a ``Prevention Index (PI)'' and all tables were rank ordered by this index. For each table, the count of NTST-MSDs, the incidence rate and 90th percentile con®dence interval are provided along with the rate ratio (the incidence rate for a particular industry divided by the rate for all industries combined). Additionally, the count rank, the rate rank, and the prevention index are included.
