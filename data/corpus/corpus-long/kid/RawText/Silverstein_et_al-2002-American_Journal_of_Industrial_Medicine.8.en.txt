Epicondylitis has less than half of the claims incidence and about half of the cost of CTS per claim but still presents a major lost time problem. Sciatica appears to be a relatively rare diagnosis (incidence rate of 4.9 per 10,000 FTEs) compared to NTST back disorders (incidence rate of 191.6 per 10,000 FTEs), however, the costs are extremely expensive (approximately $46,553 on average, $17,669 median). Research and prevention activities focused in industries with high demands for manual handling and repetitive work should contribute to the reduction of these work-related disorders.
