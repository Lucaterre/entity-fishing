Neck, back, and upper extremity NTST-MSDs are a signi®cant cause of morbidity in the working population and account for 26.4% of all accepted claims in the State Fund and 36.6% of all lost time compensable claims. Overall, these State Fund NTST-MSD claims for neck, back, and upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders in the State Fund had direct costs of $2.6 billion in 1998 dollars and 20.5 million lost workdays over the 9-year period. This is equivalent to loosing 82,000 full-time workers from the workforce over the 9-year period. While the claims incidence rates are decreasing for most but not all NTST-MSDs,

the rate of decrease is less than for all claims excluding NTST-MSDs particularly for the upper extremity. There is no signi®cant decrease for shoulder or elbow NTST-MSDs or the speci®c diagnoses of rotator cuff, or sciatica. Epicondylitis has increased. Carpal tunnel syndrome has been decreasing signi®cantly but not as rapidly as all claims excluding NTST-MSDs

Self-insured

For the Self-Insured, there were 80,230 new compensable neck, back, and upper extremity NTST musculoskeletal disorder claims. It is unfortunate that we had no diagnoses, and the data on costs and lost time were incomplete.

Comparisons with Other Studies

The 1997 combined State Fund and Self-Insured compensable claims incidence rate for neck, back, and upper extremity NTST-MSDs was 122.0 per 10,000 FTEs. This is slightly higher than the Washington 1997 BLS rate for overexertion and repetitive motion disorders (113.4 per 10,000 FTEs), which is limited to private industry only.

Surgical incidence of CTS in the Montreal adult population [] was 9 per 10,000, 19 per 10,000 for male manual workers, and 18 per 10,000 for female manual workers, with 75 and 55% of all surgical CTS attributable to work. Food and beverage processors and material handlers were among those occupations at increased risk. Tanaka et al.estimated the overall prevalence of self-reported CTS among the general US adult recently working population at 1.47%. Using the same national survey data, Blanc et al.reported a higher proportion of females reporting CTS (61%) than males. Work disability (loss or change in work) increased with an odds ratio of 1.5 per 120 min of hand bending (95%CI 1.2± 1.7). Atroshi et al.estimated a prevalence of 3.8% of CTS in a general adult population in Sweden based on CTS symptoms with clinical ®ndings, and 2.7% based on clinical

Using excessive hand force or wrist ¯exion/ extension or using vibratory tools for more than 1 hr per day was associated with signi®cantly increased prevalence of CTS. Using the same data source as Tanaka et al., Guo et al.estimated 22.4 million back pain cases among recent workers (17.9% prevalence) resulting in 149.1 million lost workdays in 1988. Approximately 65% of back pain cases were attributable to occupational activities. Similar to our ®ndings, the risks were greatest in construction and nursing occupations. Average and median costs of claims in this study are comparable to those reported by othersUsing the average costs and rates for the 1990± 1998 State Fund data, and assuming there are 96 million workers in the US (number covered by OSHAct) with an overall incidence rate of 116 per 10,000 FTEs for all upper extremity NTST-MSDs with average claim costs approximately $5,837, the total direct cost would be approximately $6.5 billion for all upper extremity NTST-MSDs per year.

There are reasons to believe that these estimates of the magnitude and costs are underestimates. For example, in a survey of the Connecticut working population, Morse et al.found that only 10.6% of those with work-related upper extremity disorders went through the workers compensation system and only 21% of those who had medical visits or procedures reported having them paid for by workers compensation. None of these ®gures take into account the indirect costs to the employer in lost productivity, quality, training replacement workers, recruitment, and other administrative costs. Nor do these ®gures take into account the quantitative and qualitative costs to the claimant and family (e.g., loss in home production), as well as those workers who never ®le a workers compensation claim but suffer from work-related back or upper extremity disorders. Morse also reported the cases in their survey had much higher dif®culties with daily tasks (bathing, child care), having lost their homes, had divorces, etc., than non-cases.

The 1997 Washington BLS rate for CTS resulting in lost time was 4.4 per 10,000 FTEs for private industry, while the 1997 compensable CTS rate for the State Fund was 16.6 per 10,000 FTEs [Bureau ofCTS workers compensation data are not available for the
