. One can regard this state of affairs as the result of the failure of our age to develop and implement a kind of rational inquiry designed to help us improve our goals, informed by aim-oriented rationalism and the philosophy of wisdom, themselves the outcome of generalizing Einstein's way of doing physics (see). 19. Perhaps, more modestly, we should say that only the top two theses of aim-oriented empiricism are synthetic a priori conjectures-theses we will never abandon because accepting them can only help, and cannot hinder, the search for knowledge whatever the universe may be like, and even though we have no grounds whatsoever to hold that they are true. (That these propositions are conjectures means that they are not synthetic a priori propositions in Kant's sense.) It is just about conceivable that we might discover that the universe is not comprehensible, and still live; it is inconceivable that we will discover that it is not partially knowable, and not meta-knowable (see

.1 in Chapter 2). 20. Reasons for accepting partial knowability and meta-knowability will be spelled out in more detail in Chapter 7. See also Maxwell (2017a, especially ch. 9; and 2017b, appendix 2). 21. In my view, the most important implications of the new way of doing physics created by Einstein in developing special and general relativity lie in fields far beyond that of theoretical physics: see the Prologue and Chapters 9 and 10 of the present volume, and. See also my articles summarizing aspects of the argument in various ways, where I attempt to spell out the implications of aim-oriented empiricism for science as a whole, for technological research, social inquiry, scholarship, education and global problems confronting humanity.

1. This argument was expounded in Chapter 2, section 2.3. It is taken up again in Chapter 5. For an earlier account, see). 2. For more recent discussions of diverse aspects of the problem, see, Votsis (2015), Cohen (2015), Sterkenburg (2016),, and Dasgupta (2016). 3. I exempt my own earlier work on the problem). 4. If the theory is formulated as a set of differential equations, then what is invariant throughout the possible phenomena to which the theory applies is what is asserted by the physically interpreted set of differential equations. Laws specifying precisely how diverse physical states evolve in space and time may be quite diverse in character: what matters is that they are all solutions of the same set of differential equations.

5. Counting entities is rendered a little less ambiguous if a system of M particles is counted as (a somewhat peculiar) field. This means that M particles all of the same kind (i.e. with the same dynamic properties) are counted as one entity. In the text I continue to adopt the convention that M particles all the same dynamically represent one kind of entity, rather than one entity. 6. For accounts of the locally gauge invariant structure of quantum field theories, see. For introductory accounts of group theory as it arises in physics, seeor Jones (1990). 7. For accounts of spontaneous symmetry breaking, see, and Griffiths (1987, ch. 11). 8. This account of unity radically simplifies and improves on the account given in Maxwell (1998, chs. 3 and 4). 9. I am grateful to Jos Uffink for drawing my attention to the two objections just discussed. 10. For further discussion of simplicity, and how terminological simplicity can be related to unity, see. 11. For a discussion of such "approximate derivations", the conclusion being strictly incompatible with the premises, see. 12. See also Chapters
