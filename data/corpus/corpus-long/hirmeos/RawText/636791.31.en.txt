The fact that AOE is able to provide a rational method of discovery, while falsificationism is not, is due to the greater rigour of AOE (a point mentioned in 3 above). AOE has greater rigour because AOE acknowledges, while falsificationism denies, metaphysical assumptions implicit in persistent scientific preference for simple, explanatory theories. It is precisely the explicit acknowledgement of these metaphysical assumptions which makes the rational method of discovery of AOE possible.

9. Diversity of scientific method. One striking feature of natural science, often commented on, is that different branches of the natural sciences have somewhat different methods. Experimental and observational methods, and methods or principles employed in constructing and assessing theories, vary as one moves from theoretical to phenomenological physics, from physics to chemistry, from astronomy to biology, from geology to ethology. Falsificationism can hardly do justice to this striking diversity of method within the natural sciences. Popper, indeed, tends to argue that there is unity of method, not only in natural science, but across the whole of science, including social science as well (see. AOE, by contrast, predicts diversity of method throughout natural science, overlaid by unity of method at a metamethodological level. AOE can do justice to the diversity of methods to be found in diverse sciences, without underlying unity and rationality being sacrificed.

It is important to appreciate, first, that different branches of the natural sciences are not isolated from one another: they form an interconnected whole, from theoretical physics to molecular biology, neurology and the study of animal behaviour. Different branches of natural science, even different branches of a single science such as physics, chemistry or biology, have, at some level of specificity, different aims, and hence different methods. But at some level of generality all these branches of natural science have a common aim, and therefore common methods: to improve knowledge and understanding of the natural world. All (more or less explicitly) put AOE into practice, but because different scientific specialities have different specific aims,at the lower end of the hierarchy of methods different specialities have somewhat different methods, even though some more general methods are common to all the sciences. Furthermore, all natural sciences apart from theoretical physics presuppose and use results from other scientific specialities, as when chemistry presupposes atomic theory and quantum theory, and biology presupposes chemistry. The results of one science become a part of the presuppositions of another, implicit in the aims of the other science (equivalent to the level 3 blueprint of physics, or the level 4 thesis of physicalism). This further enhances unity throughout diversity, and helps explain the need for diversity of method.

A key feature of AOE is that methods depend somewhat on aims, methods varying somewhat as aims vary. When the hierarchical structure of aims and methods of AOE, depicted in

.1, is applied to specific branches of natural science-geology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, organic chemistry-the various spherical discs of

.1 will need to be reinterpreted so that they come to represent the different more or less specific aims of the various branches of natural science. What the various discs of the figure depict will vary as we move from geology to neuroscience and so on-even the number of levels required will vary. What remains constant throughout all these diverse applications of AOE, however, is the hierarchical structure of aims and methods, aims becoming increasingly insubstantial and unproblematic as one goes up the hierarchy in each case.

In short, in order to exhibit the rationality of the diversity of method in natural science-apparent in the evolution of methods of a single science, and apparent as one moves, at a given time, from one scientific speciality to another-it is essential to adopt the meta-methodological, hierarchical standpoint of AOE, which alone enables one to depict methodological unity (high up in the hierarchy) throughout methodological diversity (low down in the hierarchy).Figure 2.1, in depicting the aims and methods of theoretical physics, depicts what is common to all of natural science (physics being the fundamental to all of natural science). In addition, the hierarchical structure of

.1 forms a kind of template, a paradigm, for many similarly structured but diversely interpreted depictions of aims and methods of the many diverse specialized disciplines of natural science. It is in this way that the general AOE idea can do justice both to the diverse aims and methods of different sciences at any one moment, and to the evolving aims and methods of any one science over time. At the same time, it depicts what is common to all this diversity of aims and methods: it is to be found at the metalevel, or the meta-metametalevel, and the common hierarchical structure. Furthermore, and crucially, AOE is able to provide a rationale for all this diversity of aims and methods: it does this at the metalevel, meta-methods having the role of assessing methods one step down in the hierarchy.
