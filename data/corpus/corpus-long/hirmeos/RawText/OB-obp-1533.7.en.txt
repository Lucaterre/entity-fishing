The prevalence of all usage categories reaches a level of statistical significance here, i.e. the revealed similarity takes on a systematic character. But if such a selection of categories for official publications is logical (after all, the publications of the FSB and Federal Customs Service report discovered violations), their unusual consistency with unofficial publications points in all likelihood to the adoption of official stock phrases by journalists. Does this constitute simply an extension of legal enforcement or does it reflect the journalists' weak interest in covering this topic? Or could it point to a lack of freedom [of speech], both in the selection of topics and their coverage? If the latter is correct, then one may surmise that the media unduly contribute to social enforcement. To answer these questions more research is evidently required.

Interesting conclusions can be drawn by analysing the context of the categories emphasised in the texts. Official publications do not have an emotional colour, they point dryly to the Chinese fishermen's violation of Russia's territorial borders and attempts to export resources to China: prevention of export of large cargoes to China were taken to China in the space of a few years part of the shipment was exported to China񮽙񮽙 served their sentence in Russia Chinese fishermen showed fierce oppositionnn the fishermen violated the national border and the fishermen who violated the border defended themselves.

Newspaper articles reporting on the same facts, but using such phrases, paint a far more pessimistic, and sometimes disastrous picturee Chinese fishermen ignore the border investigations lead to some organisation in China aiming to take over for that kind of crime in China they get their heads chopped off……… some restrictions were introduced for the Amur sturgeon at least, but in China fishing of king-fish is allowed in any quantity sentences that are passed in China for border violations are very strict by contrast Russia has no laws to protect goldfishhh and to take over the waters still belonging to Russia…񮽙.

Linguistic devices inciting phobia in order to maintain the unacceptability of Chinese poaching are common. Factuall evidence is also employed for these aims, provoking widespread, often negative, discussion of the transfer of islands to China:

The fact is that Chinese fishermen, even before the demarcation of the area of Tarabarov and Bolshoi Ussurii islands, began to take over the waters still belonging to Russia. Border guards claim that poachers in the area began to violently resist arrest, arguing that they were catching their own fish in their own territory Sergeev .

The media discusses negatively not only the poaching carried out in Russian waters, but more generally any fishing activities in the Amur by the Chinese, including those carried out in their own waters:

Khabarovsk residents have heard that our Chinese neighbours exploit the fish stocks of the "mur far more actively than us… stating that the Chinese and us have different attitudes to the river-is not saying anything new, Sergey Denisovich argues Pimin .

Interestingly, certain scientific texts (which because of their paucity were not analysed quantitatively) include similar rhetoric:

Poaching by Chinese fishermen is the scourge of the Middle "mur.

Uncoordinated with the Russian side, the construction of dams on the Chinese coast will lead to an intensification of the erosion of our coast. In fact, China will certainly play a leading role in the ecological destabilisation of the Amur basin and of the river itself. If Russia and China do not take action, the additional human impacts on the larger ecosystem of the Amur basin may lead to a regional environmental crisis even without any dams on the main riverbed Podolskyi and Gotvinskyi .

The social basis of texts that discuss or mention Russian poaching on the Amur River differs significantly in terms of words most frequently used and include the following categories: fish, roubles, thousands, poacher, Amur, Russia, market, goods and the past. Overall, these texts show much more diversity in both form and content and deal with characteristic stocks, the consumer market and its security problems and market competition with China: this year red fish is increasingly directed towards "eijing but even the increase in domestic prices in Russia in comparison to

China does not bring more humpback salmon to native stalls but Russians do not see it on their shelves or tables and Chinese businesses quickly pay for goods delivered and, if necessary, in cash, unlike Russian companies. They also note that poachers only play a secondary rolee The number of poachers in the lower reaches of the Amur River has decreased significantly fishing enterprises and national communities, let alone poachers, fish in the lower reaches of the "mur and half are caught by poachers and by the unemployed population.. It is interesting that a few texts about fishing activities on the Amur border river published on the Russian-speaking Chinese sites give a sense of acknowledgement by their neighbours of their guilt. Contextual use of categories most frequently encountered underscore the social significance of fishing for local populations (ethnic groups, descendants of fishermen), and of the ongoing efforts to increase fish stocks which were previously destroyed in a predatory mannerr The border line between China and Russia had been fully settled Chinese fishing industries foster the protection of rare types of fish that live in the Heilongjiang this is the third release of young fish organised by the Chinese government more than 20 tons of quality young fish are found in this river Fish from the river represents the main source of income for local residents her father is a fisherman, a husband-a veterannn fisherman Guan Sanchen, a member of the Xibo ethnic group there, as before, the population engages in fishing activities Russia and China are world powers 񮽙China and Russia act jointly and on both sides of the border one find Russian and Chinese houses.
