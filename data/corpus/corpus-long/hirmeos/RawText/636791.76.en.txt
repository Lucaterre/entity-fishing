Corresponding to these aberrant theories there is a hierarchy of aberrant versions of physicalism, all of which assert that there is an abrupt change in the laws of nature at 2050. The aberrant theories, just as empirically successful as the theories we accept, render the aberrant versions of physicalism just as scientifically fruitful as non-aberrant versions of physicalism are rendered by the non-aberrant theories we actually accept. If we take it as given that we accept non-aberrant theories, the question of what reasons there are for rejecting empirically successful aberrant theories and associated aberrant versions of physicalism does not arise. But the moment we seek to justify acceptance of non-aberrant theories and rejection of aberrant theories, within the framework of AOE, the question of what reasons there are for rejecting aberrant theories and associated aberrant versions of physicalism arises. If AOE is bereft of meta-knowability, it is not easy to see what these reasons can be. But AOE with meta-knowability included does provide a reason: the aberrant versions of physicalism assert that this is a type (iii) universe, which violates meta-knowability.

Versions of physicalism(n) for which n = 1 or 3, and N > 1 would seem to violate meta-knowability. But other versions of physicalism with N > 1 need not clash with meta-knowability.5.10 Conclusions

I have argued that if science is to be rigorous it needs to accept explicitly, as a core component of theoretical scientific knowledge, a hierarchy of metaphysical theses (and associated methods) concerning the dynamic unity, the physical comprehensibility, of the universe. I have shown that the notorious problem concerning the unity, the explanatory character, of physical theory can be solved within this hierarchical view of science. This solution, in turn, provides a precise way of assessing the scientific fruitfulness of rival metaphysical theses, from the standpoint of the empirical progressiveness of the research programmes to which they give rise.

These results have dramatic implications for science, for our understanding of science, and for the relationship between science and philosophy. There is a major increase in the (acknowledged) scope of scientific knowledge. Whereas standard empiricism implies that science at present provides us with no knowledge about the ultimate nature of the universe (all current fundamental physical theories being false), the hierarchical view holds the opposite. Current science does include knowledge about the ultimate nature of the universeknowledge which, though theoretical and conjectural, is nevertheless more secure than any accepted theory such as quantum theory or general relativity: physicalism(5-7) is true, even perhaps physicalism(8). Science becomes much more like natural philosophy, in that it incorporates sustained exploration and assessment of metaphysical theses, and associated metholodogical rules, as an integral, vital part of scientific research. Instead of metaphysics and philosophy being banished from science, they become a vital part of science.

Furthermore, as I have argued in detail elsewhere, the arguments of this chapter, when extended to take into account, not just the implicit metaphysical assumptions of science, but its implicit value and political assumptions as well, have even more dramatic implications not just for physics or natural science, but for social science, for the humanities, for academic inquiry as a whole.

Perhaps the time has come for philosophers to take note of these arguments that have such revolutionary implications for our intellectual landscape.

Comprehensibility rather than beauty 6.1 Beauty or comprehensibility?

Many scientists, and some philosophers of science, have acknowledged that aesthetic considerations play, quite properly, an important role in influencing acceptance and rejection of theories in science, in addition to empirical considerations. A famous example is Dirac, who went as far as to declare: "It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment" (quoted in McAllister, 1996, p. 15).

The view that beauty ought to influence choice of theory in science faces, however, a serious problem. Why should beauty be a good indication of truth? Unless the truth is beautiful, and unless we have valid grounds for holding this to be the case, there can be no good reasons, it would seem, for giving preference to beautiful theories in science.

Not only may it seem dubious that we can have grounds for holding that the truth is beautiful; there may well seem to be grounds for holding that it is wildly implausible that the truth should be beautiful, especially in theoretical physics.

Whether we find something beautiful or ugly must depend, to some extent at least, on our personal, subjective, emotional responses to that thing. Aesthetic criteria have their roots deep in the human psyche, and in human culture. But physical reality, that which theoretical physics seeks to grasp, is utterly remote from the human psyche, from human culture. It may well seem utterly implausible that something as anthropomorphic, as personal, as quintessentially human and subjective, as ideas about beauty, should have anything to do with the ultimate nature of the physical universe, utterly impersonal and remote from the circumstances of human life. Beauty may seem to be the last consideration to take into account in assessing the merits of rival fundamental theories in physics.
