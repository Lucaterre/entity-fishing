. MAI, too, stresses that there are different kinds of unification (McAllister, 1996, p. 110) but, unlike AOE, does not relate these to one basic conception of unity.

Symmetry: Here, again, AOE and MAI both recognize that the demand for symmetry takes a number of different forms, but AOE alone holds that these, in so far as they are methodologically legitimate within theoretical physics, all relate to the one basic demand for unity. One of the achievements of AOE is to demonstrate clearly how different kinds of symmetry relate to unity, the demand that theories exhibit symmetries itself being an aspect of the demand for unity. MAI recognizes that theories exhibit different kinds of symmetry, but fails to recognize that different kinds of symmetry, in theoretical physics at least, are aspects of unity.

Metaphysical allegiance: Once again, both AOE and MAI recognize that an important non-empirical requirement in theoretical physics, upheld by some physicists at least, is that fundamental physical theories should accord with some metaphysical view. Both recognize that metaphysical views associated with physics since Galileo have changed dramatically over time; both recognize that different physicists espouse different metaphysical views at the same time. But AOE and MAI differ here too, in that AOE holds that diverse, evolving level 3 blueprints, in order to be acceptable, need to accord with physicalism, whereas MAI makes no such demand. For AOE, the requirement that a theory exemplifies a metaphysical view, in so far as it is methodologically legitimate, is but an aspect of the basic requirement that the body of fundamental physical theory exemplifies the unity of physicalism (as much as possible). MAI makes no such demand.

Simplicity:

Here, yet again, both AOE and MAI recognize that the demand for simplicity takes a number of different forms; both see simplicity as being related to unity, but in somewhat different ways. But AOE alone relates the demand for simplicity to the more basic demand for just one kind of unity, dynamic unity postulated by physicalism. According to AOE, unity requires that a theory makes the same assertion throughout all possible phenomena to which it applies; simplicity concerns what is asserted for any given phenomenon, and thus presupposes unity. Simplicity presupposes unity, but is quite distinct from unity (see

The difference that this reveals in the two views can be summed up like this. AOE postulates just one basic non-empirical requirement, unity, and relates different requirements, of different kinds of unitysymmetry, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity-to this one demand for unity. MAI, by contrast, holds that there just are many different kinds of requirements-unity, symmetry, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity. Unlike AOE, MAI sees no unity in these diverse kinds of requirements-unity, symmetry, metaphysics and simplicity. (In this respect, AOE might be said to give a more unified, and hence more beautiful, account of scientific method than MAI.) More substantial differences arise in connection with the two remaining kinds of aesthetic properties of theories which MAI holds to be methodologically significant, which I now consider in turn.

Invocation of a model: AOE recognizes that an important consideration in assessing a new physical theory is that it has a form similar to existing empirically successful physical theories. Thus the acceptability of quantum electroweak theory, and chromodynamics is much helped by the fact that these theories are similar in form to the highly empirically successful theory of quantum electrodynamics. All three theories, despite their differences, are locally gauge invariant quantum field theories. According to AOE, this requirement of similarity of form or structure derives, once again, from the requirement of unity). If T 1 and T 2 have some similar structures, then some part of T 1 can be modelled by some part of T 2 , and vice versa. According to AOE, having a model is only methodologically significant to this extent, and once again this requirement turns out to be derived from the demand for unity. (Of course, that physical reality is a model of a theory, in the sense that the theory is true, is highly significant for AOE; but this is not what MAI means by a "model".) MAI is, once again, much more open-ended in the kind of models that it is prepared to recognize as methodologically significant, and does not attempt to derive from the demand for unity the requirement that a theory should have some kind of model. Visualizability/ abstractness: According to AOE, neither visualizability nor abstractness are methodologically significant for theoretical physics. What does matter is that a theory can at least be interpreted realistically, as postulating that such and such a physical entity, (or entities), such as a field (or particles) exists, a stepping stone towards the ubiquitous, unified something of physicalism. (Actually, AOE demands more. It demands that fundamental physical theories are open to being interpreted in terms of conjectural essentialism (see
