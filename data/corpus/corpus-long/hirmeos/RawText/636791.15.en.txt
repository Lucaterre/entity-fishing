). Popper died a week after a serious operation, on 17 September 1994.

Popper's reputation, after his death, has suffered a curious fate. Most philosophers and philosophers of science recognize the significance of Popper's work for twentieth-century philosophy of science, but seem to hold that it has little to contribute to the field in the second decade of the twenty-first century. Popper has become somewhat pass√©. Many scientists, on the other hand, hold Popper in high esteem, and even call upon his work during the course of debates about scientific matters-a point made recently by

As far as Popper's reputation among philosophers is concerned, a part of the problem is that too few philosophers have responded to a central feature and claim of Popper's work: that the basic task of philosophy is to tackle, and try to help solve, urgent, fundamental problems that have their roots outside the discipline, in science, politics, the arts, the environment, education-problems which, if solved, may well have widespread fruitful implications for such diverse fields. And as far as the philosophy of science is concerned, the discipline has developed in the twenty-first century in ways that would have horrified Popper. Philosophy of science has increasingly succumbed to what was, for him, the ultimate intellectual sin: specialization. It has fragmented into philosophy of physics, biology, chemistry, psychology, neuroscience and so on-mirroring specialization in science, and doing nothing to counteract it. The fundamental problems about the nature of the cosmos, our place in the cosmos, and our knowledge and understanding of it, that so gripped Popper's imagination, are increasingly ignored.

In the rest of this book, I set out to subject Popper's ideas to ferocious criticism in an attempt to improve them. It will emerge that Popper's ideas about science, reason, quantum theory, academic inquiry, how to make progress towards a more civilized world, all need radical revision. In order to do justice to what is best in Popper's philosophy, some of its tenets must be rejected-including what is, perhaps, its most famous tenet, the principle of demarcation. My hope is that Popper's whole approach to doing philosophy will come to be seen as highly relevant to the tasks that face us today: to provoke the thought of humanity into tackling, imaginatively, critically, and fruitfully, the gigantic problems that confront the modern world. Freed of some deadwood, Popper's work becomes highly relevant to today's global problems, both practical and intellectual.
