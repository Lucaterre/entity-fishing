Lakatos sought to reconcile the very different views of science held by Popper and Kuhn. According to Kuhn, far from seeking falsifications of the best available theory, as Popper held, scientists protect the accepted theory, or "paradigm", from refutation for most of the time, the task being to fit recalcitrant phenomena into the framework of the paradigm. Only when refutations become overwhelming, does crisis set in; a new paradigm is sought for and found, a revolution occurs, and scientists return to doing "normal science", to the task of reconciling recalcitrant phenomena with the new paradigm. Lakatos sought to reconcile Popper and Kuhn by arguing that science consists of competing fragments of Kuhnian normal science, or "research programmes", to be assessed, eventually, in terms of their relative empirical success and failure. Instead of research programmes running in series, one after the other, as Kuhn thought, research programmes run in parallel, in competition, this doing justice to Popper's demand that there should be competition between theories (a point emphasized especially by Feyerabend).Lakatos became so impressed with the Kuhnian point that theories always face refutations, the empirical successes of a theory being a far more important guide to scientific progress than refutation, that he finally came to the conclusion that Popper's philosophy of science was untenable.

AOE has a number of features in common with Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes. AOE makes extensive use of the notion of scientific research programme. Like Lakatos's view, AOE exploits the idea that such research programmes can, sometimes, be compared with respect to how empirically progressive they are. AOE, again like Lakatos's view, sees the whole of science as a gigantic scientific research programme. And, like Lakatos's view, AOE can be construed as synthesizing Popper's and Kuhn's views.

But there are also striking differences. There are differences in the way scientific research programmes are conceived, especially research programmes in fundamental physics. For Lakatos, the main components of a research programme are the "hard core" (corresponding to Kuhn's "paradigm"), and the "protective belt" of "auxiliary hypotheses", which facilitate the application of the hard core to empirical phenomena. The main business of a research programme is to develop the protective belt, thus extending, and making more accurate, the empirical predictions of the hard core. The hard core is a testable theory rendered metaphysical by the methodological decision not to allow it to be refuted, refutations being directed at the protective belt rather than the hard core.

According to AOE, by contrast, the metaphysical kernel of a research programme is not a testable theory but rather a thesis that is genuinely metaphysical (i.e. more or less unspecific, and usually untestable)-a thesis such as the corpuscular hypothesis, Boscovich's point-atom blueprint, Einstein's unified field blueprint and so on. The basic aim of the programme is to turn the relatively unspecific blueprint into a precise, testable (and true) physical theory. The research programme thus consists of a succession of theories, T 1 , T 2 â€¦ T n , which can be compared, not only with respect to empirical success, but also with respect to how adequately each theory encapsulates, or exemplifies, the blueprint of the programme. (The latter is not possible within a Lakatosian programme.) Whereas a Lakatosian programme has a fixed basic theory (or hard core), and seeks to improve auxiliary hypotheses (the protective belt), an AOE programme strives to capture the blueprint more and more adequately by means of testable physical theories. Both Lakatos's view and AOE permit one to see natural science as one gigantic research programme, but how this programme is construed is very different. For Lakatos, "science as a whole can be regarded as a huge research programme with Popper's supreme heuristic rule: 'devise conjectures with more empirical content than their predecessors' ". The huge research programme of natural science has, for Lakatos, no hard core; to this extent, Lakatos's view is a variant of Popper's.According to AOE, however, if natural science is viewed as one gigantic research programme, then it does have something like a hard core. First, there is physicalism at level 4, a metaphysical but nevertheless substantial thesis about the nature of the universe. And then there is the current blueprint at level 3, an even more substantial metaphysical thesis about the nature of the universe. These provide severe constraints on what theories are acceptable that are not straightforwardly empirical,something that is not possible given the views of Popper or Lakatos (or even Kuhn).Lakatos and AOE have very different motivations for taking scientific research programmes so seriously. For Lakatos, the motivation comes from appreciating that a scientific theory, T, cannot be decisively refuted at an instant, as it were, partly because auxiliary hypotheses can always be invented to salvage T from a refutation, partly because early applications of a new theory, such as Newton's, may make simplifying assumptions which may well lead to false predictions (the fault lying with the simplifying, auxiliary hypotheses rather than the basic theory).
