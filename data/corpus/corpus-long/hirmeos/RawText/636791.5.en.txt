And there is a further, even more devastating point. Popper's methodological rules favour T + h 1 + h 2 + h 3 over T, especially if h 1 , h 2 and h 3 have been severely tested and corroborated. But in scientific practice, T + h 1 + h 2 + h 3 would never even be considered, however highly corroborated it might be if considered, because of its extreme lack of simplicity or unity, its grossly ad hoc character. There is here a fundamental flaw in the central doctrine of L., Popper put forward a new methodological principle which, when added to those of L.Sc.D., succeeds in excluding theories such as T + h 1 + h 2 + h 3 from scientific consideration. According to Popper, a new theory, in order to be acceptable, "should proceed from some simple, new, and powerful, unifying idea about some connection or relation (such as gravitational attraction) between hitherto unconnected things (such as planets and apples) or facts (such as inertial and gravitational mass) or new 'theoretical entities' (such as field and particles)" (p. 241). T + h 1 + h 2 + h 3 does not "proceed from some simple, new and powerful, unifying idea" and is to be rejected on that account, even if more highly corroborated than T.

But the adoption of this "requirement of simplicity" (as Popper calls it) as a basic methodological principle of science, has the effect of permanently excluding from science all ad hoc theories (such as T + h 1 + h 2 + h 3 ) that fail to satisfy the principle, however empirically successful such theories might be if considered. This amounts to assuming permanently that the universe is such that no ad hoc theory, that fails to satisfy Popper's principle of simplicity, is true. It amounts to accepting, as a permanent item of scientific knowledge, the substantial metaphysical thesis that the universe is non-ad hoc, in the sense that no theory that fails to satisfy Popper's principle of simplicity is true. But this clashes with Popper's criterion of demarcation: that no unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is to be accepted as a part of scientific knowledge.

It is, in fact, important that Popper's criterion of demarcation is rejected, and the metaphysical thesis of non-ad hocness is explicitly acknowledged to be a part of scientific knowledge. The thesis, in the form in which it is implicitly adopted at any given stage in the development of science, may well be false. Scientific progress may require that it be modified. The thesis needs to be made explicit, in other words, for good Popperian reasons, namely so that it can be critically assessed, and perhaps improved. As long as Popper's demarcation criterion is upheld, the metaphysical thesis must remain implicit, and hence immune to criticism.

Popper's falsificationism can be modified, however, so that substantial metaphysical theses, implicit in methods that exclude ad hoc theories, are made explicit within science, and are thus rendered available to critical scrutiny and revision (as we shall see in subsequent chapters; see also

On publication, L.Sc.D. achieved a certain impact; it was quite widely reviewed and discussed, and led to Popper being invited to give lectures in England, Denmark and elsewhere. Popper himself later claimed that his criticisms of logical positivism led eventually to the downfall of that doctrine.

1.5 The Open Society

Having dealt with the methodology of the natural sciences, Popper turned his attention again to what had long been of concern to him: the intellectual defects of Marxism, and the philosophy of the social sciences. But before he could get very far with that work, Popper was offered a lectureship at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. He accepted, and Popper and his wife left Vienna for New Zealand early in 1937.

For some years Popper had been privately highly critical of policies of socialists in Germany and Austria for playing into the hands of the Fascists and Hitler. This was due, in Popper's view, to the harmful influence of Marxism. But he had kept these criticisms to himself, as he felt any public criticism could only weaken the forces opposing Hitler. Then, in March 1938, Hitler occupied Austria, and Popper felt all grounds for restraint had disappeared. He decided to put his criticisms of Marxism, and his views on the social sciences, into a publishable form.

He began work on what was to become The Poverty of Historicism. But then, unexpectedly, sections on essentialism, and on totalitarian tendencies in Plato, grew and grew (driven by the desperation of the times), and Popper found he had a new work on his hands: it became what is perhaps his best known, most influential and greatest work, The Open Society and Its
