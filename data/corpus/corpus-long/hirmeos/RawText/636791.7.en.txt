Popper argues that a number of elements of Marxist thought are of value, if not taken too far. There is the idea that the social cannot be reduced to the psychological, sociology not being reducible to psychology. There is the thesis that much of history has been influenced by class struggle, and the idea that the means of production, economic circumstances, play an important role in influencing the development of other aspects of social and cultural life, even something as apparently remote from economic conditions as mathematics. Above all, there is the recognition and depiction of the appalling conditions of life of the poor in the unrestrained capitalist conditions of Marx's time, and the recognition, too, of the hypocrisy of much of the morality, the legal system and the politics of those times. Having described Marx's account of the working conditions of children as young as six years, Popper writes: "Such were the conditions of the working class even in 1863, when Marx was writing Capital; his burning protest against these crimes, which were then tolerated, and sometimes even defended, not only by professional economists but also by churchmen, will secure him forever a place among the liberators of mankind" (1966a, vol. 2, p. 122).

But these good points are, for Popper, more than counterbalanced by the dreadful defects, most of which stem from Marx's historicism, inherited from Hegel. For the central tenet of Marxism is the idea that the laws of dialectical materialism determine the evolution of the means of production, and this in turn determines the evolution of everything else, from class struggle to culture, religion, the law and politics. But this is manifestly false. For one thing, there is a two-way interaction between economic conditions and ideas; eliminate scientific and technological ideas, and the economy would collapse. For another, ideas can themselves influence the course of history, Marxism itself being an example. Historical predictions made by Marx, on the basis of his economic historicism, have been falsified by subsequent historical events. The Russian Revolution is, for example, entirely at odds with Marx's theory, as is the way in which the unrestricted capitalism of Marx's time has subsequently become both more economically successful and more just and humane as a result of diverse political interventions. Marx's economic historicism is not just false; it is pseudoscientific. Only for exceptionally simple systems, such as the solar system, is long-term prediction, based on scientific theory, possible. In the case of social systems, incredibly complex and open to the influence of a multitude of unpredictable factors, the idea that science should be able to deliver long-term predictions is hopelessly unwarranted. Marx's historicism leads him to turn good points into bad ones by exaggeration. "The history of all hitherto existing society is a history of class struggle" (quoted in Popper, 1966a, vol. 2, p. 111) is a good point if "all" is not taken too seriously, but as it stands is an oversimplification and exaggeration; it ignores, for example, power struggles within the ruling class. Again, Marx was surely right to see legal and political institutions of his time as being biased in the direction of the interests of the ruling classes; but he was wrong to condemn all legal and political institutions as inevitably having this function, as his economic historicism compelled him to do.

For Popper, the most damaging feature of Marx's historicism has to do, perhaps, with the severe limitations that it places on the power of politics, on the capacity of people to solve social problems. Marx is famous for his eleventh thesis on Feuerbach: "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point however is to change it" (quoted in. But Marx's economic historicism leads immediately to a severely restricted view as to what political intervention can achieve. In Capital he declares: "When a society has discovered the natural law that determines its own movement, â€¦ even then, it can neither overleap the natural phases of its evolution, nor shuffle them out of the world by a stroke of the pen. But this much it can do; it can shorten and lessen its birth-pangs" (quoted ibid., p. 86). Just those actions which were to improve the unrestrained capitalism of Marx's time beyond all recognition, namely political intervention and the actions of trade unions, are discounted at the outset by Marx's economic determinism as necessarily impotent. Political planning and policymaking for socialism is condemned by Marx, in line with his central doctrine, as inherently inefficacious and Utopian. One disastrous consequence of this was that when Marxists gained power in Russia, they found their literature contained no guidelines as to how to proceed. Another disastrous consequence was that Marxism, blind to the potency of political power, failed to anticipate the dangers inherent in handing over power to political leaders after the revolution, dangers which, after the Russian Revolution, became all too manifest.
