is made up of two truncated invariant functions, stuck together at x = 2. Functions that appear in theoretical physics are analytic; that is, they are repeatedly differentiable. Such functions have the remarkable property that from any small bit of the function, the whole function can be reconstructed uniquely, by a process called "analytic continuation". All analytic functions are thus invariant. The latter notion is, however, a wider one, and theoretical physics might, one day, need to employ this wider notion explicitly, if space and time turn out to be discontinuous, and analytic functions have to be abandoned at a fundamental level.

A similar remark needs to be made about Goodman's (1954) paradox concerning "grue" and "bleen". Modifying the paradox slightly, an object is grue if it is green up to time t, blue after t; it is bleen if it is blue up to time t, green after t. Sometimes it is held that there is perfect symmetry between blue and green, on the one hand, and grue and bleen on the other, especially as "emeralds are green" is equivalent to "emeralds are grue up to t, and bleen afterwards". But this symmetry is merely terminological and, as we have already seen in connection with the aberrant version of Newton's theory of gravitation, discussed in section 4.2, terminological symmetry does not mean there is symmetry of content. That there is not symmetry of content in the grue/ bleen case can be demonstrated as follows. If emeralds are grue, a person convinced of this can determine whether t is future or past merely by looking at emeralds. But if emeralds are green, a person convinced of this cannot say whether t is in the future or past by just looking at emeralds. The content, the meaning, of grue and bleen contains an implicit reference to t in a way in which that of green and blue do not. Doubtless symmetry can be created by considering two possible worlds, ours and a Goodmanesque one with special physics and/ or physiology of vision so that grue emeralds do not appear to change at t, whereas green ones do. This, however, is to consider conditions quite different from those specified by Goodman. The crucial point to make, in any case, is that dynamical or physical properties, of the kind attributed to physical entities by physical theories (interpreted in a conjecturally essentialistic way), are like blue and green, and unlike grue and bleen, in not containing any implicit reference to specific times or places (or hypersurfaces of S that distinguish one region of S from another). Physical properties must be invariant in a sense that corresponds to the invariance of allowed functions in physics. The more general notion of property, which includes Goodmanesque properties, is excluded, just as the more general notion of function, which includes (2) above as an "unchanging" function, is excluded.

4.4 Further issues

What of the other aspects of the problem of non-empirical requirements in science mentioned in the introduction? Here are a few brief remarks concerning some of these further issues.

Most of the other terms used to refer to non-empirical requirements can be straightforwardly related to unity. We have seen that this is true of symmetry and invariance. Non-ad hoc, organic, inwardly perfect and non-aberrant can be interpreted as appealing to unity, and harmonious, beautiful and conceptually coherent can be interpreted as presupposing unity. A dynamical physical theory can be held to be explanatory in character to the extent that it is (1) empirically contentful, and (2) unified.

Simplicity, however, is quite different. The simplicity of a theory can be interpreted as having to do, not with whether the same laws apply throughout the space S, but rather with the nature of the laws, granted that they are the same. Some laws are simpler than others. In order to overcome the objection that simplicity is formulation-dependent it is essential, as in the case of unity, to interpret "simplicity" as applying to the content of theories, and not to their formulation, their axiomatic structure, etc. Theories can only, at best, be partially ordered with respect to degrees of simplicity. Even when two theories are amenable to being assessed with respect to relative simplicity, there is always the problem that a change of variables may reverse the assessment. Let the two theories be (1) y = x, and (2) y = x 2. We judge (1) to be simpler than (2). Let x 2 = z. We now have (1) y = z , and (2) y = z. Now (2) is simpler than (1). Assessment of relative simplicity of two theories may only be unambiguous when restrictions are placed on the form that physical variables can take, so that only linear transformations of the type z = Ax + B (where A and B are constants) are permitted, for example. It is a further great success of the theory presented here that it succeeds in distinguishing sharply between these two aspects of physical theory, the unity and simplicity aspects, and succeeds in explicating both.
