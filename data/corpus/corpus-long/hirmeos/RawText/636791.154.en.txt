. See the previous chapter, section 4.1, note 3 and associated texts for various attempts to solve the problem, and criticisms of those attempts. 14. The account of theoretical unity given here and in the last chapter simplifies the account given in, where unity is explicated as "exemplifying physicalism", where physicalism is a metaphysical thesis asserting that the universe has some kind of unified dynamic structure. Explicating unity in that way invites the charge of circularity, a charge that is not actually valid (see. The account given here forestalls this charge from the outset. 15. This point is of fundamental importance for the problem of induction. Traditionally, the problem is interpreted as the problem of justifying exclusion of empirically successful theories that are ad hoc in sense (1): how can evidence from the past provide grounds for any belief about the future? This makes the problem seem highly "philosophical", remote from any problem realistically encountered in scientific practice. But the moment it is appreciated that the problem of justifying exclusion of empirically successful theories that are ad hoc in sense (1) is just an extreme, special case of the more general problem of excluding empirically successful theories that are ad hoc in senses (1) to (8), it becomes clear that this latter problem is a scientific problem, a problem of theoretical physics itself. For the implications of this crucial insight, and for a proposal as to how the problem of induction is to be solved that exploits this insight, see. See also Chapter 7 of the present work, and, especially ch. 9).

be changed. Before the problem of induction can be solved, we need to change the currently accepted conception of science; indeed, we need to change, not just our conception of science, but science itself. Properly conceived, the problem of induction involves formulating a new conception of the aims and methods of science, more rigorous than current conceptions, which is such that the problem of induction no longer arises. The task is not to justify the status quo, but to change the status quo so that the problem of justification no longer arises. Popper's failed attempt at solving the problem stands head and shoulders above the rest just because it fits this prescription: it consists of a new view about the aims and methods of science, a new philosophy of science, namely falsificationism. 7. Aim-oriented empiricism was first expounded in. It was spelled out in greater detail in). 8. For the AOE account of what theoretical unification means, see Chapter 4. 9. In what follows "accept T" implies, not just "accept T as a working hypothesis for further research", but also "accept T for the purposes of technological and other practical applications, including contexts where human life may depend on the predictions of T being true". 10. All the possible phenomena, predicted by any dynamical physical theory, T, may be represented by an imaginary "space", S, each point in S corresponding to a particular phenomenon, a particular kind of physical system evolving in time in the way predicted by T. In order to specify severely disunified rivals to T that fit all available evidence just as well as T does, all we need do is specify a region in S that consists of phenomena that have not been observed, and then replace the phenomenon predicted by T with anything we care to think of. Given any T, there will always be infinitely many such disunified rivals to T. 11. For a more detailed discussion of empirically successful ad hoc rivals to accepted theories, see, ch. 4). 12. The two prescriptions for formulating empirically more successful rivals to accepted unifying theories, indicated in this and the previous paragraph, can of course be combined to create further more empirically successful disunified rival theories. 13. This needs to be amended in two ways. In the first place any number of approximate disunified theories would be implied by the true, unified "theory of everything" (supposing there is such a thing). If, for example, we take Newtonian theory as standing in for the true, unified theory of everything, then we can derive from this theory a combination of appropriately approximate versions of Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Galileo's laws of terrestrial motion, which, put together, constitute a disunified theory, true if Newtonian theory is true. "Science assumes that the universe is such that no disunified theory is true", must be amended to read, "Science assumes that the universe is such that no precise disunified theory is true". But even this amendment is not sufficient. Newtonian theory implies different, precise laws of planetary motion for the different planets in their orbits round the sun. Gather these precise laws together, and one has a precise but thoroughly disunified theory of planetary motion. These laws are, however, specific to precise specifications of initial conditions: initial relative positions and velocities, and masses. These laws cease to be true (granted that Newtonian theory is true), if the initial conditions are changed even slightly (in a way which does not obtain during the orbit of the planet in question). In other words, these laws cease to be consequences of Newtonian theory the moment they are interpreted to apply to a range of values of initial conditions (of the indicated kind), however minute this range of values might be. We must amend the statement in the text to read: "Science assumes that the universe is such that no precise disunified theory is true, where the components of the disunified theory are interpreted to apply to a range of values of initial conditions (of the appropriate kind), however minute that range might be." What does "of the appropriate kind" mean here? It means this. Variables that characterize initial conditions are "of the appropriate kind", if the component laws of the disunified theory apply only to different values of these variables. These variables are such, in other words, that in order to move from conditions for which one component law of the disunified theory applies, to conditions for which another component law applies, it is the value of these variables that we need to change. The range of values must not correspond to different states of the physical system that evolve from just one precise initial state of the system. 14.
