Unfortunately, the philosophes of the Enlightenment got all three points disastrously wrong. They failed to capture correctly the progress-achieving methods of natural science (in that they defended inductivist, or at least verificationist, conceptions of science); they failed to generalize these methods properly; and, most disastrously of all, they failed to apply them properly so that humanity might learn how to become more civilized or enlightened by rational means. Instead of applying the generalized progress-achieving methods of science to social life itself, so that social progress might be achieved, the philosophes sought to apply scientific method merely to social science. Reason (as construed by the philosophes) got applied, not to the task of making social progress towards an enlightened world, but to the task of making intellectual progress towards greater knowledge about the social world. Social inquiry was developed, not as social methodology or social philosophy, but as social science. That the philosophes made these blunders in the eighteenth century is forgivable; what is unforgivable is that these blunders still remain unrecognized and uncorrected today, over two centuries later. Instead of correcting the blunders, we have allowed our institutions of learning to be shaped by them as they have developed throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, so that now the blunders are an all-pervasive feature of academia, as we shall see in more detail in a moment.

10.3 Popper's contribution to the Enlightenment Programme

As I have already indicated, Popper made enormously important improvements to the Enlightenment Programme inherited from the eighteenth century. Inductivism and verificationism become falsificationism. Traditional conceptions of reason, with all the emphasis on proof and justification, become critical rationalism. These improvements, at steps (i) and (ii) of the Enlightenment Programme, become all-important when it comes to step (iii): the application of reason to social life, to politics, to problems of living, to political philosophy. As a result of bringing about a revolution in our conception of scientific method, and of rationality more generally, Popper in effect transforms the very idea of "the rational society", so that this ceases to be something that is morally and politically abhorrent, and becomes both highly desirable, and achievable, instead.

Given traditional, pre-Popperian conceptions of science and reason, which tend to see science as establishing secure knowledge of truth by means of evidence, and tend to see reason as establishing truth by means of deductive argument, the "rational society" can only be a society determined, or at least severely constrained, by "the rules of reason". Reason becomes a kind of tyrant. Individual liberty, diversity of views and ways of life, wayward imagination, disagreement and protest would all be suppressed by the iron rule of reason and logic. Granted such verificationist, authoritarian conceptions of reason, 8 the "rational society" can only be regarded as a kind of nightmarish totalitarian state, the very opposite of democracy and liberalism.No wonder the Romantics protested.

But Popper's revolutionary ideas about science and reason change all this dramatically. First, granted Popper's falsificationist conception of scientific method, imagination plays a crucial role in science. Imagination is needed to dream up new wild speculations, subsequently to be submitted to ferocious attempts at empirical refutation. Second, plurality of conflicting theories is absolutely essential for scientific progress, not only to increase the store of theories to be submitted to attempted refutation, but in order to ensure that theories are severely tested in the first place. As I have already mentioned, in order to make sense of the idea of severe testing, we need to see the experimentalist as having at least the germ of an idea for a rival theory up his sleeve (otherwise testing might degenerate into performing essentially the same experiment again and again). This means experiments are always crucial experiments, attempts at trying to decide between two competing theories. Theoretical pluralism is necessary for science to be genuinely empirical.Both these points carry over when Popper's falsificationist conception of scientific method is generalized to form critical rationalism. Reason, quite generally, is at a loss without imagination. Imagination is required to dream up possible solutions to problems, which can then be submitted to severe criticism. Again, plurality of views is an essential ingredient of Popper's conception of reason. Criticism can only deliver a good idea as to how to solve a problem if there is a plurality of ideas to criticize in the first place. And merely in order to criticize an idea, one needs to have some kind of rival idea in mind, at least as a possibility. Rationality, as construed by Popper, requires plurality of ideas, values, ways of life; the freedom to imagine, to criticize authority, dogma and received opinion. It demands sustained tolerance of diversity of views and ways of life, together with the existence of traditions of criticism, so that good ideas may be selected from a pool of not-so-good ideas. Reason, as Popper emphasizes, needs to be seen in social, political and institutional terms
