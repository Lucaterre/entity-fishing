We assume, that is, that length and time are unaaected by motion, and that if a pulse of light has velocity c along the x-axis in the +ve direction in R 1 , then its velocity in R 2 isscc-v.

What Einstein realized was that if rates of clocks and lengths of rods are aaected by relative motion, so that x 2 ==x 1-vt 1 and t 2 ==t 1 are both false, then it is entirely possible that any given pulse of light has the same velocity c in both R 1 and R 2-indeed, the same velocity c in all inertial reference frames.

It turns out that the thesis that light does have the same velocity in all inertial reference frames-which is implied by P 1 plus P 2-suces to fix uniquely just how the coordinates of R 1 and R 2 are related. All that we need, in addition, is that the relationship is symmetric (which may be said to be inherent in P 1 in any case), linear and isotropic. With these assumptions it is not hard to show that the coordinates of R 1 and R 2 are related by the following equations, the "Lorentz" transformations:

According to these equations, all but uniquely determined by P 1 plus P 2 , relative motion contracts rods and makes clocks go slow, but in such a way that the velocity of light is c in all inertial frames. The miracle of reconciling P 1 and P 2 has been achieved.

Special relativity has a number of startling implications. One is that mass, along with the speed of clocks and length of objects, is aected by uniform motion, so that m 2 = m 1 /(l-v 2 /c 2 ) 1/2 , where m 1 is the mass of an object in rest frame R 1 , with respect to which the object is at rest, and m 2 is the mass of an object in R 2. Another implicationthe most famous of all-is that mass is a form of energy, in accordance with E = mc 2 .

From the standpoint of aim-oriented empiricism, special relativity is doubly significant. First, the way in which Einstein discovered special relativity exemplifies the method of discovery of aim-oriented empiricism, to the extent that Einstein used the method IIhave indicated above::namely, creating a new theory as the outcome of resolving a clash between two existing theoriess-thus creating greater conceptual and theoretical unification. Second, and quite strikingly, special relativity itself exemplifies aim-oriented empiricism, and in an important sense cannot be adequately understood within the framework of standard empiricism. For, as Einstein himself remarks in his "Autobiographical Notes", two pages on from the quotation givennabove:

The universal principle of the special theory of relativity is contained in the postulate:: The laws of physics are invariant with respect to the Lorentz-tranformations â€¦ This is a restricting principle for natural laws, comparable to the restricting principle of the non-existence of the perpetuum mobile which underlies thermodynamics.
