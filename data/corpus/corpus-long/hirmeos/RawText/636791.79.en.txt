All this contrasts dramatically with criteria arrived at by the aesthetic induction, according to MAI, which are almost bound to be conservative, and more or less inapplicable to revolutionary developments. AOE criteria anticipate and provoke revolution, and judge the existing body of fundamental physical theory as unsatisfactory because of its failure to comply with the demand for unity (the standard model postulates too many particles and forces, and clashes with general relativity); by contrast, MAI criteria are conservative, and are almost bound to be at odds with revolutionary developments. AOE criteria are heuristically powerful; MAI criteria are the opposite. Furthermore, AOE criteria, associated with level 3 blueprints, evolve or improve as physics makes progress, and in a way which admits some elements of continuity (see, in particular, Maxwell, 1998, pp. 80-9). MAI sees change, but no overall progress, in non-empirical criteria, and holds, in a quasi-Kuhnian fashion, that revolutions create a rupture in aesthetic criteria, there being no account of the modification and generalization of blueprints, which AOE provides.

MAI and AOE agree that non-empirical criteria apply, not to any specific formulation of a theory, but to what all formulations have in common. But there are somewhat different accounts of what this is. According to MAI, a formulation-independent theory is an abstract entity that exists in its own right, with its own properties distinct from the phenomena the theory postulates (see, for example,. This leaves obscure what sort of thing such an abstract entity is, and what its relationship is with a linguistic formulation of the theory, and with the phenomena it predicts. According to AOE, the matter is much more straightforward: a formulation-independent theory, T, is the content of T, what T predicts, or asserts to be the case. AOE does not appeal to the abstract entities of MAI; it appeals only to possible phenomena, not as actually existing entities, but merely as possibilities. The claim that T exhibits a certain symmetry thus amounts to the claim that the phenomena predicted by T exhibit this symmetry. There is here no mystery about the relationship between a linguistic formulation of T, the abstract entity T, and the phenomena T predicts: the "abstract entity" is just what any linguistic formulation of T asserts to be the case, the content of T. This leads to an account of the importance of linguistic-dependent criteria of simplicity, something that MAI does not provide.

A fundamental difference between MAI and AOE, encapsulated in the title of this chapter, is that, whereas MAI holds that aesthetic criteria are important in science, AOE denies this, all non-empirical criteria for theory choice being reducible to the demand that the totality of fundamental physical theory exemplify the level 4 thesis of physicalism or, more specifically, the best available blueprint at level 3. For AOE, what matters is unity or comprehensibility, not beauty.

But this difference is terminological rather than substantial. McAllister defends a projectivist, subjectivist account of the beauty of theories. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, rather than in the theory itself.Scientists judge certain theories to be beautiful because of non-aesthetic properties that they possess objectively; it is these nonaesthetic properties that are important methodologically and epistemologically, and play the crucial role in the aesthetic induction. One of these is metaphysical allegiance. The demand that the totality of fundamental physical theory should exemplify physicalism, and the best available blueprint, are special cases of metaphysical allegiance. Comprehensibility is just one of McAllister's aesthetic properties. Comprehensibility, one might say, is beautiful. It fits perfectly Hutchinson's characterization of beautyas involving "uniformity amidst variety" (see the discussion of "unity through diversity" in Maxwell, 1998, ch. 3).

A more serious disagreement would seem to be that whereas AOE recognizes only one methodologically significant non-empirical property, namely unity or comprehensibility, MAI stresses that there are endlessly many, falling under the five headings of symmetry, invocation of a model, visualizability/ abstractness, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity (related to unity).

This disagreement is not quite as big as it might at first appear to be. Here, very briefly, are the similar, but also different, ways in which AOE and MAI treat unity, symmetry, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity.

Unity: AOE and MAI both recognize that the demand for unity takes a number of different forms, but AOE alone holds that these are aspects of just one, single conception of unity. According to AOE, dynamic unity, postulated to exist by physicalism, can be broken in thought in a number of different ways, this creating a number of different kinds of (relative) disunity, and hence a number of different ways in which degrees of unity (or disunity) can be assessed. But these different kinds of disunity all relate to just one conception of unity, namely that which is postulated to exist by physicalism (see
