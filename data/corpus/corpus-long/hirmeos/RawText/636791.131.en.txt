Academic philosophy, more generally, has perhaps improved somewhat in recent decades. The worst excesses of ordinary language philosophy have died away, and many academic philosophers strive to engage with serious problems that arise in connection with serious issues: injustice, environmental degradation, war, science, politics, how to live. Old habits of thought nevertheless linger on. Open any issue of Mind (a leading journal of philosophy) and one can still find papers published in the tradition of analytic philosophy. I cannot help but note that philosophers of science, and philosophers more generally, have by and large remained uninterested in my attempts to draw their attention to the argument that the aims and methods of academia are profoundly and damagingly irrational when judged from the standpoint of helping to promote human welfare.Another regrettable development is the loss of what one might call the idea of the liberal university. When I started out as a young academic, in the mid 1960s, the idea was still around that a university should concentrate on, first, hiring good people, and then, second, giving them the freedom to teach and do research as they themselves saw fit, the job of the administration being to provide support for these two essential university activities. In the UK at least, research assessments, committee work, loss of tenure, short-term contracts, restricted funding and increasing power of the administration seem together to have all but destroyed this idea of the liberal university.

On the other hand, there have been a number of recent developments (at the time of writing) in the UK-and no doubt elsewherewhich can perhaps be interpreted as constituting first steps towards putting universalism, or critical specio-fundamentalism, into academic practice. A number of new departments, institutes and centres have been created devoted to policy and peace studies. Growing concern about environmental problems, especially those associated with climate change, have led to the founding of new institutions which seek to bring specialists together to engage in relevant interdisciplinary research, and to communicate with government, the media and the public. Thus at the University of Cambridge there is the Cambridge Environmental Initiative (CEI), launched in December 2004, which brings together diverse specialized fields of research to work on environmental problems, and holds seminars and public lectures to put research scientists in touch with one another, and with the public. A similar coordinating, interdisciplinary initiative exists at the University of Oxford. It is called the School of Geography and the Environment, and it was founded in 2005 (under another name). At University College London (UCL), my own university, there is a recent and very active initiative called the Grand Challenges programme, which seeks to bring together a wide range of specialists to work on seven broad themes all having to do with human wellbeing. A policy document produced in 2011 is called "The Wisdom Agenda". 58 It seeks to "deliver a culture of wisdom" at UCL. There is also the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, founded by twenty-eight scientists from ten different universities or institutions in 2000. It is based in six British universities, has links with six others, and is funded by three research councils, NERC, EPSRC and ESRC (environment, engineering, and social and economic research). In recent years many scientists have become concerned to involve the public in debate about questions of science policy.There is now an active movement which seeks to promote public engagement with science.In 2015, Nature produced a special issue devoted to interdisciplinarity. One article argues that it is vital to "bridge the divide between the biophysical and the social sciences" in order to tackle global problems, but goes on to stress just how difficult this is to do. The authors suggest five principles which help such interdisciplinary work succeed. Another contribution discusses the problems that confront efforts to set up interdisciplinary research. Proponents of interdisciplinarity complain that funding, career prospects and status all favour disciplinary rather than interdisciplinary work. Much depends, however, on how close or distant from one another the component disciplines of interdisciplinary work are-the more distant, the greater the obstacles to success. Especially difficult is the task of combining science and humanities. Another contribution attempts to assess the extent to which interdisciplinarity is increasing. It turns out that there is, at least, an increase in papers that mention "interdisciplinary" in the title). Throughout this special issue of Nature, it is assumed that we need a kind of science-a kind of academic inquiry-well designed from the standpoint of helping us solve problems in the real world. It is argued that interdisciplinarity will suffice to provide what is required. But it will not. We need to instigate sustained imaginative and critical thinking about our fundamental problems-intellectual and humanitarian-at the heart of the academic enterprise, this to be conducted in such a way that it interacts both with more specialized academic problem solving, and with thinking in the social world, guiding personal, social, institutional, national and global life.
