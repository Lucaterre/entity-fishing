How did this extraordinary state of affairs arise? Essentially because, as quantum theory (QT) developed with the work of Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Born and others, no solution was found to the quantum wave/ particle problem. As we have seen, this problem was first discovered by Einstein with his invention of light quanta-or "photons" as they subsequently came to be called. The problem was further intensified in 1923 when de Broglie proposed that electrons, up till then believed to be particles, have a wave-like aspect associated with them, as was subsequently confirmed experimentally by Davisson and Germer. In order to develop QT as a realistic theory, it would have been necessary to solve the quantum wave/ particle problem in such a way that it is possible to specify, consistently and precisely, what sort of physical entities photons and electrons are as they evolve in space and time independently of measurement. This did not happen. Instead, Heisenberg invented matrix mechanics in 1925, intending, from the outset, that the theory should predict the outcome of measurements but should remain silent about what exists physically in the absence of measurement. Schrödinger invented wave mechanics in 1926 with the hope that the wave aspect of quantum entities would turn out to be fundamental. This hope was dashed when it became clear that the ψ-function could not be regarded as describing quantum reality directly, but had to be interpreted as containing probabilistic information about the results of performing measurements on an ensemble of similarly prepared systems-as Born was the first to point out.

We can begin to see some of the reasons for Einstein's vehement rejection of OQT as a satisfactory theory (despite its immense empirical success). It was Einstein after all who, in a sense, invented quantum theory. Planck introduced the idea that the energy E of an oscillator of frequency 񮽙 is quantized in accordance with EE==nh񮽙 as a calculational device, not as a new hypothesis incompatible with classical physics. Planck's aim was to deduce his empirical law of black-body radiation from the basic postulates of classical physics. He was dismayed to discover that the quantization of energy contradicted classical physics, and he spent the next fifteen years or so trying to remove this defect from his derivation. It was Einstein, and initially Einstein alone, who appreciated that Planck's work spelt the downfall of classical physics, a new beginning being required. In this sense, Einstein initiated quantum theory with his paradoxical "heuristic" hypothesis that light consists of discrete quanta with energy EE==h񮽙, even though light also undeniably has a continuous wave-like character. For Einstein around 1905, the fundamental task of the new theory, needed to replace classical physics, would be to solve the riddle of the nature of quantum reality in view of its ostensibly contradictory particle and field aspects. No wonder Einstein was dismayed when the new theory was developed deliberately to evade and not to solve this basic quantum riddle.

But there is more than this to Einstein's opposition to OQT. As II have stressed above, the failure to solve the quantum wave/particle problem ensures that OQT cannot be interpreted realistically, which in turn ensures that OQT must be interpreted as making (probabilistic) predictions about the results of performing measurements. But this in turn has a variety of disastrouss-though rarely noticedd-consequences. For it means that OQT only issues in actual physical predictions if some part of classical physics (CP) is adjoined to OQT for a treatment of measurement. OQT alone can only issue in conditional predictions of the type::if a measurement of observable AAis made, the outcome will be one or other of the values (a 1 … a n ) with probabilities (p 1 … p n ),,with:

And even this goes too far::strictly speaking, according to OQT, a quantum mechanical state 񮽙 can only be attributed to a system in so far as the system has been subjected to some preparation procedure, which must be specified by means of CP. Thus OQT, devoid of CP, has no physical content whatsoever. It is only OQT + CP which has physical content. But OQT + CP, considered as a fundamental theory of physics, is a disaster. It is (i)) grossly ad hoc or aberrant, in that it consists of two conceptually incoherent parts, OQT and CP. It is (ii) imprecise, because the circumstances in which CP is to be applied are only specified in terms of measurement, and the notion of measurement cannot be made precise. It is (iii) ambiguous because the theory does not decide unambiguously between probabilism and determinism. It is (iv) non-explanatory, not only because of the ad hoc character of the theory, but also because the theory is obliged to presuppose some part of what it is intended to explain, namely CP. The theory is (v) severely restricted in scope in that it cannot be applied to conditions which exclude the possibility of measurement, such as early states of the universe.
