. Without referring anywhere to Hitler or Stalin, the book is, nevertheless, an urgent and passionate investigation into the problem and threat of totalitarianism, whether of the right or left. It seeks to understand what the appeal of totalitarianism can be, and why it should have come to be such a threat to civilization. Popper regarded the writing of the book as his contribution to the war effort.

In The Open Society and Its Enemies (O.S.E.), Popper argues that a fundamental problem confronting humanity is that of moving from a closed, tribal way of life to an open society. The closed society is a society that has just one view of the world, one set of values, one basic way of life. It is a world dominated by dogma, fixed taboos and magic, devoid of doubt and uncertainty. The open society, by contrast, tolerates diversity of views, values and ways of life. In the open society learning through criticism is possible just because diverse views and values are tolerated. For Popper, the open society is the civilized society, in which individual freedom and responsibility, justice, democracy, humane values, reason and science can flourish.

But moving from the closed to the open society imposes a great psychological burden on the individuals involved, "the strain of civilization". Instead of the security of the tribe, organic, dogmatic and devoid of doubt, there is all the uncertainty and insecurity of the open society, the painful necessity of taking personal responsibility for one's life in a state of ignorance, the lack of intimacy associated with the "abstract society", in which individuals constantly rub shoulders with strangers. This transition from the closed to the open society is, for Popper, "one of the deepest revolutions through which mankind has passed" (1966a, vol. 1, p. 175). Many cannot bear the burden of freedom and doubt, and long for the false security and certainties of the closed society. In particular, some of the greatest thinkers of Western civilization have given into this temptation and have, in one way or another, urged upon long-suffering humanity a return to something like a closed society under the guise of Utopia. This is true of Plato and Aristotle; and it is true, in more recent times, of Hegel and Marx. The lure of totalitarianism is built deep in our history and traditions.

The revolutionary transition from closed to open society first occurred, according to Popper, with the "Great Generation" of ancient Athens in the fifth century BC. Those to be associated with the birth and affirmation of the open society include Pericles, Herodotus, Protagoras, Democritus, Alcidamas, Lycophron, Antisthenes and, above all, Socrates.

It is from Plato, especially, that we learn of Socrates' passionate scepticism, his searching criticism of current beliefs and ideals, his conviction that first one must acknowledge one's own ignorance before one could hope to acquire knowledge and wisdom. But Socrates, Popper argues, was ultimately betrayed by Plato. The greatest advocate of the open society became, in Plato's Republic, the spokesman for a return to a closed society. sense of facts and his sincere quest for the truth, his important contributions to historical studies and social science, his burning desire to help the oppressed. Nevertheless, Marx is one of the most dangerous enemies of the open society, his thought disastrously corrupted by its Hegelian inheritance.

In a well-known passage in Capital, Marx declared that Hegel "stands dialectics on its head; one must turn it the right way up again" (quoted in. And in another passage, Marx declared: "It is not the consciousness of man that determines his existence-rather, it is his social existence that determines his consciousness" (quoted ibid., p. 89). Whereas, for Hegel, an idealist, history is the dialectical development of ideas, for Marx history is determined by the dialectical development of material processes, in particular those associated with the means of production. Distinct historical phases-pre-feudal, feudal, capitalistic, post-revolutionary socialistowe their existence to distinct phases in the means of production, and the social arrangements these phases generate. Each phase leads, as a result of inevitable dialectical processes, to its own destruction and the creation of the next phase. Thus capitalism concentrates wealth and ownership of the means of the production into fewer and fewer hands until, eventually, the workers unite, overthrow the capitalists and establish socialism. The historical processes of dialectical materialism work themselves out through class struggle; classes and the conflicts between them being determined by the means of production. It is the laws determining the evolution of the economic base that decide the path of history; ideas, democratic and legal institutions form an ideological superstructure, which reflects the economic base and the interests of the dominant class, but is powerless to influence the path of history. Marx condemned as "Utopian" those socialists who sought to bring about the revolution by means of political policies and plans. He held that the proper "scientific" approach to bringing about socialism is, first, to discover the dialectical laws governing the evolution of the economic base of society, and then to help this evolution along, in so far as this is possible, thus speeding up the coming of the final, inevitable socialist revolution.
