Any one-thesis view faces the even more serious problem of how this one thesis is to be critically assessed, revised and improved. The hierarchical view of AOE overcomes this problem by providing severe constraints on what is to be revised, and how this revision is to proceed. In the first instance, and even then in quite exceptional circumstances, only the current level 3 thesis can be revised. This revision must proceed, however, within constraints provided by the level 4 thesis of physicalism, on the one hand, and accepted, empirically successful level 2 theories, on the other hand. In a really exceptional situation, scientific progress might require the revision of the level 4 thesis of physicalism, but this too would proceed within the constraints of the thesis at level 5, and empirically successful theories at level 2, or empirically progressive research programmes at levels 2 and 3. The great merit of AOE is that it separates out what is most likely to be true from what is most likely to be false in the metaphysical assumptions of physics, and employs the former to assess critically, and to constrain, theses that fall into the latter category. It concentrates criticism and innovation where it is most likely to promote scientific progress.

Finally, any one-thesis view cannot, as we have seen, simultaneously call upon principles (1) to (4) above to justify acceptance of the single thesis, whatever it may be. The hierarchical view of AOE is able to do just that. It can appeal to different principles, (1) to (4) above, to justify (to provide a rationale for) acceptance of the different theses at the different levels of the hierarchy of AOE.Thus acceptance of the thesis at level 7 is justified by an appeal to (2); acceptance of theses at levels 3 to 5 are accepted as a result of (a) an appeal to (3), and (b) compatibility with the thesis above in the hierarchy. The thesis at level 6 is accepted as a result of an appeal to (4). Aberrant rivals to theses accepted at levels 3 to 5 (which might be construed to support aberrant, rival empirically progressive research programmes) are excluded on the grounds that these clash with the thesis at level 6.It may be objected that AOE suffers from vicious circularity, in that acceptance of physical theories is justified by (in part) an appeal to physicalism, the acceptance of which is justified, in turn, by the empirical success of physical theory. My reply to this objection is that the level 6 thesis of meta-knowability asserts that the universe is such that this kind of circular methodology, there being positive feedback between metaphysics, methods and empirically successful theories, is just what we need to employ in order to improve our knowledge. The thesis of meta-knowability, if true, justifies implementation of AOE. This response is only valid, of course, if reasons for accepting the level 6 thesis of metaknowability do not themselves appeal to the success of science (which would just reintroduce vicious circularity at a higher level). As I made clear above, the two arguments given for accepting meta-knowability make no appeal to the success of science whatsoever.A basic idea of AOE is to channel or direct criticism so that it is as fruitful as possible, from the standpoint of aiding progress in knowledge. The function of criticism within science is to promote scientific progress. When criticism demonstrably cannot help promote scientific progress, it becomes irrational (the idea behind (2) above). In an attempt to make criticism as fruitful as possible, we need to try to direct it at targets which are the most fruitful, the most productive, to criticize (from the standpoint of the growth of knowledge). This is the basic idea behind the hierarchy of AOE. Conjectures at all levels remain open to criticism. But, as we ascend the hierarchy, conjectures are less and less likely to be false; it is less and less likely that criticism, here, will help promote scientific knowledge. The best currently available level 3 conjecture is almost bound to be false: at this level, the history of physics reveals, as I have indicated above, that a number of different conjectures have been adopted and rejected in turn. Here, criticism, the activity of developing alternatives (compatible with physicalism), is likely to be immensely fruitful for progress in theoretical physics. Indeed, elsewhere I have argued that this provides physics with a rational, though fallible and nonmechanical method for the discovery of new fundamental physical theories,a method invented and exploited by Einstein in discovering special and general relativity (see the next chapter) something which Popper has argued is not possible (see. Criticizing physicalism, at level 4, may also be fruitful for physics, 21 but (the conjecture of AOE is that) this is not as likely to be as fruitful as criticism at level 3. And, as we ascend the hierarchy (so AOE conjectures), criticism becomes progressively less and less likely to be fruitful. Against that, it must be admitted that the higher in the hierarchy we need to modify our ideas, so the more dramatic would be the intellectual revolution that this would bring about. If physicalism is rejected altogether, and some quite different version of the level 5 conjecture of comprehensibility is adopted instead, the whole character of natural science would change dramatically; physics, as we know it, might even cease to exist.
