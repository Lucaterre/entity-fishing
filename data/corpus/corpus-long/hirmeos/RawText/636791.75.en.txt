But how can such a circular procedure conceivably be valid? This is not an objection to the arguments and views put forward so far. No attempt has been made to justify claims to theoretical knowledge. The argument has been modest: granted acceptance of current physical theories and adoption of current methods, then physics is more rigorous (in that it accords better with PIR) if implicit metaphysical assumptions are made explicit, and those assumptions chosen which seem best to promote what we take to be scientific progress. The circularity objection would arise, however, if we were to go beyond the modest aspirations of sections 5.2 to 5.8, and attempt to solve the problem of induction,and justify acceptance of empirically successful unifying theories, within the context of AOE. But this does, in effect, amount to an objection to AOE. For it may be argued that AOE cannot be acceptable because the problem of induction cannot conceivably be solved within its framework: the moment the attempt is made to justify acceptance of scientific theories and metaphysical theses as claims to knowledge, vicious circularity sets in. How is this circularity objection to be met?

Here, in a nutshell, is the answer. Permitting metaphysical assumptions to influence what theories are accepted, and at the same time permitting theories to influence what metaphysical assumptions are accepted, may (if carried out properly), in certain sorts of universe, lead to genuine progress in knowledge. The level 6 thesis of meta-knowability, of AOE, asserts that this is just such a universe. And furthermore, crucially, reasons for accepting meta-knowability make no appeal to the success of science. In this way, meta-knowability legitimises the potentially invalid circularity of AOE depicted in

Relative to an existing body of knowledge and methods for the acquisition of new knowledge, possible universes can be divided up, roughly, into three categories: (i) those which are such that the metamethodology of AOE can meet with no success, not even apparent success, in the sense that new metaphysical ideas and associated methods for the improvement of knowledge cannot be put into practice so that success (or at least apparent success) is achieved; (ii) those which are such that AOE can meet with genuine success; and (iii) those which are such that AOE appears to be successful for a time, but this success is illusory, this being impossible to discover during the period of illusory success. Meta-knowability asserts that this universe is a type (i) or (ii) universe; it rules out universes of type (iii).

Meta-knowability asserts, in short, that the universe is such that AOE can meet with success and will not lead us astray in a way in which we cannot hope to discover by normal methods of scientific inquiry (as would be the case in a type (iii) universe). If we have good grounds for accepting meta-knowability as a part of scientific knowledge-grounds which do not appeal to the success of science-then we have good grounds for adopting and implementing AOE (from levels 8 to 3).

But what grounds are there for accepting the thesis of metaknowability at level (6)? There are two:(a) Granted that there is some kind of general feature of the universe which makes it possible to acquire knowledge of our local environment (as guaranteed by the thesis at level 8), it is reasonable to suppose that we do not know all that there is to be known about what the nature of this general feature is. It is reasonable to suppose, in other words, that we can improve our knowledge about the nature of this general feature, thus improving methods for the improvement of knowledge. Not to suppose this is to assume, arrogantly, that we already know all that there is to be known about how to acquire new knowledge. Granted that learning is possible (as guaranteed by the level 8 thesis), it is reasonable to suppose that, as we learn more about the world, we will learn more about how to learn. Granted the level 8 thesis, in other words, metaknowability is a reasonable conjecture. (b) Meta-knowability is too good a possibility, from the standpoint of the growth of knowledge, not to be accepted initially, the idea only being reluctantly abandoned if all attempts at improving methods for the improvement of knowledge fail.

(a) and (b) are not, perhaps, very strong grounds for accepting metaknowability; both are open to criticism. But the crucial point, for the present argument, is that these grounds for accepting meta-knowability, (a) and (b), are independent of the success of science. This suffices to avoid circularity. If AOE lacks meta-knowability, its circular procedure, interpreted as one designed to procure justified knowledge, becomes dramatically invalid, as the following consideration reveals. Corresponding to the succession of accepted fundamental physical theories developed from Newton down to today, there is a succession of aberrant rivals which postulate that gravitation becomes a repulsive force from the beginning of 2050, let us say.
