The very fact that the totality of our sense experiences is such that by means of thinking (operations with concepts, and the creation and use of definite functional relations between them, and the coordination of sense experiences to these concepts) it can be put in order, this fact is one which leaves us in awe, but which we shall never understand. One may say "the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility". It is one of the great realizations of Immanuel Kant that the postulation of a real external world would be senseless without this comprehensibility.

In speaking here of "comprehensibility", the expression is used in its most modest sense. It implies: the production of some sort of order among sense impressions, this order being produced by the creation of general concepts, relations between these concepts, and by definite relations of some kind between the concepts and sense experience. It is in this sense that the world of our sense experiences is comprehensible. The fact that it is comprehensible is a miracle.

In my opinion, nothing can be said a priori concerning the manner in which the concepts are to be formed and connected, and how we are to coordinate them to sense experiences. In guiding us in the creation of such an order of sense experiences, success alone is the determining factor. All that is necessary is to fix a set of rules, since without such rules the acquisition of knowledge in the desired sense would be impossible. One may compare these rules with the rules of a game in which, while the rules themselves are arbitrary, it is their rigidity alone which makes the game possible. However, the fixation will never be final. It will have validity only for a special field of application (i.e., there are no final categories in the sense of Kant).This, once again, is tantalizingly close to aim-oriented empiricism. Einstein recognizes clearly that only in a very special kind of universe-a comprehensible universe-is scientific explanation and understanding possible. He recognizes that the particular way the universe is assumed to be comprehensible at any stage in the development of science will lead to rules or principles-such as Galilean or Lorentz invariance, the principle of equivalence, conservation of momentum and energy-without which physics would be impossible. And he points out that these rules are not final: it is to be expected that they will change as science advances. All this accords beautifully with aim-oriented empiricism. What violates aim-oriented empiricism is the suggestion that there is no Kantian synthetic a priori proposition built into scientific knowledge. According to aim-oriented empiricism, there are two such propositions, namely, partial knowability and meta-knowability at levels 7 and 6 of Figure 2.1 (see Chapter 2).We cannot of course know for certain that these propositions are true. They must remain forever conjectures-all our knowledge being conjectural in character. Nevertheless, we can be confident that we will always accept these propositions as a part of scientific knowledge. We are rationally entitled to accept partial knowability as a part of scientific knowledge because, if it is false, we cannot acquire knowledge of our local circumstances whatever we assume. There can be no circumstances in which it would be in the interests of the pursuit of knowledge of truth to reject partial knowability. And as for meta-knowability, accepting this proposition can only help, and cannot hinder, the pursuit of knowledge of truth, whatever the universe may be like. Both are synthetic a priori conjectures, accepted permanently because of the crucial role that they play in the pursuit of knowledge.In short, these two propositions are synthetic a priori statements not in the full-blooded Kantian sense that they can be known to be true of all possible experience with absolute certainty, but in the radically qualified Kantian sense that they are conjectures about reality-about the noumenal world-which must remain permanently an integral part of conjectural human knowledge, and which are adopted as knowledge on non-empirical grounds. This crucial tenet of aim-oriented empiricism is, it seems, explicitly rejected by Einstein in the above passage-even though the whole point of the passage, ironically enough, is to affirm it, affirm, that is, that science cannot proceed without the assumption that the universe is knowable, even comprehensible.

Einstein's ambivalent attitude to the crucial issue which separates off standard from aim-oriented empiricism gains explicit expression in the following quotation:

[The aim of science is to arrive] at a system of the greatest conceivable unity, and of the greatest poverty of concepts of the logical foundations, which is still compatible with the observations made by our senses. We do not know whether or not this ambition will ever result in a definite system. If one is asked for his opinion, he is inclined to answer no. While wrestling with the problems, however, one will never give up the hope that this greatest of all aims can really be attained to a very high degree.
