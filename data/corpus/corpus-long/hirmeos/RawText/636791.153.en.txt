). 4. An earlier version of this chapter was delivered as a talk at a conference on "Induction, Confirmation and Science" at the London School of Economics on 10 March 2007. It was then perhaps rather more paradoxical to talk of "scientific metaphysics" than it is now, at the time of. This is because, in recent years, as I mentioned in Chapter 2, note 8, something approaching a research industry in the philosophy of science has emerged devoted to the topic "the metaphysics of science" (see note 7 below and associated text). "Scientific metaphysics" has rather lost its paradoxical air. 5. It is widely appreciated that some metaphysical theses have influenced science in the context of discovery, in influencing scientists to try to develop certain sorts of theories, and to ignore others (see, for example,. What is being argued here is very different. I argue that there are metaphysical theses, neither falsifiable nor verifiable, which are an integral part of theoretical scientific knowledge, more firmly established, indeed, than such highly corroborated theories as quantum theory and general relativity. Science is more rigorous if this is acknowledged rather than denied. All this differs dramatically even from Popper's later views concerning the important role that metaphysical research programmes play in science (see. Popper held on to his demarcation criterion to the end, and never wavered from holding metaphysical theses, however scientifically fruitful, to be "unscientific" (for discussion of this point, see Chapter 4 and Maxwell, 2012).. Some of this work argues for conjectural essentialism, the anti-Humean view that theoretical physics should be interpreted as seeking to discover, not just physical laws, or regularities in phenomena, but rather "necessitating properties" possessed by fundamental physical entities which determine, necessarily, that the entities in question evolve in accordance with specified laws. This is a view I argued for decades ago (see). 8. All the possible phenomena, predicted by any dynamical physical theory, T, may be represented by an imaginary "space", S, each point in S corresponding to a particular phenomenon, a particular kind of physical system evolving in time in the way predicted by T. In order to specify severely disunified rivals to T that fit all available evidence just as well as T does, all we need do is specify a region in S that consists of phenomena that have not been observed, and then replace the phenomena predicted by T with anything we care to think of. Given any T, there will always be infinitely many such disunified rivals to T. This point is inherent in Nelson Goodman's "new paradox of induction" (see, although the kind of empirically successful disunified rivals considered by Goodman in his discussion of "grue" and "bleen" are but one kind of a number of kinds of disunified theories, as we shall see in section 5.3. There is a vast philosophical literature on the underdetermination of theory by evidence.

For an excellent recent discussion, and reference to further literature, see Howson (2000, especially ch. 1, pp. 30-4, 75-7, and ch. 5). See also Lipton (2004). 9. For a more detailed discussion of empirically successful ad hoc rivals to accepted theories, seeclaims that this argument cannot establish that physics assumes the truth of some more or less unified physical theory, and the falsity of all seriously disunified rival theories. It is, however, especially in the context of practical applications that physics requires predictions of accepted theories to be true, and clashing predictions of rival theories to be false. In contexts such as bridge-building, for example, we do indeed need to assume that relevant accepted laws will yield true predictions, and better empirically established but disunified rivals, that predict the bridge will collapse, are false. (Human lives are at stake.) In making such an assumption, against the evidence, we implicitly assume the truth of a metaphysical thesis concerning the unity of phenomena. For a more detailed rebuttal of Vicente's claim, see Maxwell (2010b, pp. 673-4). 11. It may be objected that the universe might have been genuinely disunified, so that physics could consist only of a great number of physical laws. In this case, it may be argued, physics could not be construed as making a metaphysical assumption about underlying unity. But even in this counterfactual situation, endlessly many very much more disunified but empirically more successful rival laws could easily be formulated: these would have to be rejected on nonempirical grounds, or physics would drown in an ocean of rival laws. The persistent rejection of such much more disunified but empirically more successful rivals would involve the methods of physics making an implicit metaphysical assumption, to the effect that nature is unified to some extent at least (all grossly disunified laws being false). It is necessary to make some such assumption, however disunified the totality of accepted laws may be-even if the assumption made is rather weak in character, in that only gross disunity is denied. 12.
