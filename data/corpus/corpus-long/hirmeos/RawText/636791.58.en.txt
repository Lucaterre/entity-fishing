What this means is that there are different kinds of disunity, different dimensions of disunity, as one might say, some more serious than others, but all facets of the same basic idea. We can, I suggest, distinguish at least eight different facets of disunity, as follows.

Any dynamical physical theory, T, can be regarded as specifying an abstract space, S, of possible physical states to which the theory applies, a distinct physical state corresponding to each distinct point in S. (S might be a set of such spaces.) For unity, we require that T asserts that the same dynamical laws apply throughout S, governing the evolution of the physical state immediately before and after the instant in question. If T postulates N distinct dynamical laws in N distinct regions of S, then T has disunity of degree N. For unity, we require N = 1. The eight different kinds of disunity can be characterized like this.

(1) T divides space-time up into N distinct regions, R 1 … R N , and asserts that the laws governing the evolution of phenomena are the same for all space-time regions within each R-region, but are different within different R-regions.

Example: the aberrant version of Newtonian theory (NT) indicated above, for which the degree of disunity N = 2 in a type (1) way.

(2) T postulates that, for distinct ranges of physical variables (other than position and time), such as mass or relative velocity, in distinct regions, R 1 … R N of the space of all possible phenomena, distinct dynamical laws obtain.

Example: T asserts that everything occurs as NT asserts, except for the case of any two solid gold spheres, each having a mass of between one and two thousand tons, moving in otherwise empty space up to a mile apart, in which case the spheres attract each other by means of an inverse cube law of gravitation. Here, N = 2 in a type (2) way.

(3) In addition to postulating non-unique physical entities (such as particles), or entities that are unique but not spatially restricted (such as fields), T postulates, in an arbitrary fashion, N-1 distinct, unique, spatially localized objects, each with its own distinct, unique dynamic properties.

Example: T asserts that everything occurs as NT asserts, except there is one object in the universe, of mass 8 tons, such that, for any matter up to 8 miles from the centre of mass of this object, gravitation is a repulsive rather than attractive force. The object only interacts by means of gravitation. Here, N = 2 in a type (3) way.

(4) T postulates physical entities interacting by means of N distinct forces, different forces affecting different entities, and being specified by different force laws. (In this case one would require one force to be universal so that the universe does not fall into distinct parts that do not interact with one another.)

Example: T postulates particles that interact by means of Newtonian gravitation; some of these also interact by means of an electrostatic force F = Kq 1 q 2 / d 2 , this force being attractive if q 1 and q 2 are oppositely charged, otherwise being repulsive, the force being much stronger than gravitation. Here, N = 2 in a type (4) way.

(5) T postulates N different kinds of physical entity, 5 differing with respect to some dynamic property, such as value of mass or charge, but otherwise interacting by means of the same force.

Example: T postulates particles that interact by means of Newtonian gravitation, there being three kinds of particles, of mass m, 2m and 3m. Here, N = 3 in a type (5) way.

(6) Consider a theory, T, that postulates N distinct kinds of entity (e.g. particles or fields), but these N entities can be regarded as arising because T exhibits some symmetry (in the way that the electric and magnetic fields of classical electromagnetism can be regarded as arising because of the symmetry of Lorentz invariance, or the eight gluons of chromodynamics can be regarded as arising as a result of the local gauge symmetry of SU

). If the symmetry group, G, is not a direct product of subgroups, we can declare that T is fully unified; if G is a direct product of subgroups, T lacks full unity; and if the N entities are such that they cannot be regarded as arising as a result of some symmetry of T, with some group structure G, then T is disunified. 6 Example: Classical electrodynamics postulates two fields: the electric and the magnetic fields. However, the relative strengths of these fields differ when measured in different inertial reference frames travelling with uniform velocity with respect to each other, although the strength of the combined electromagnetic field does not. But, according to special relativity, laws have the same form with respect to all inertial reference frames. We may hold that the electric and magnetic fields are not two distinct entities. They are, rather, two aspects of one unified entity, the electromagnetic field. To this extent, N = 1 as far as classical electrodynamics is concerned.
