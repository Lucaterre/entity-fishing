In 1982-3 there appeared The Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery, a three-volume work which extends and elaborates doctrines and arguments of L.Sc.D., and much of which was written in the years 1951-6. The work reached the stage of proofs in 1956-7, but was abandoned because Popper suffered from detached retinas and had operations on both eyes, his sight for a time in question. It was only much later, under the editorship of W. W. Bartley III, and after some additions and rewriting, that the work finally appeared.

Volume one, entitled Realism and the Aim of, restates and elaborates Popper's earlier views and arguments concerning induction, falsification, corroboration, demarcation, realism, metaphysics and probability. At one point Popper illuminatingly contrasts how a scientific paper might be written in the style of inductivism, and in the critical, problem-solving approach of falsificationism and critical rationalism (see pp. 47-51).

Volume two, entitled The Open Universe: An Argument for Indeterminism (1982a), sets out to refute determinism. Popper distinguishes between "scientific" and metaphysical determinism. "Scientific" determinism asserts that future states of physical systems can be predicted with any degree of precision by means of theories and initial conditions specified with sufficient precision (see p. 36). Metaphysical determinism asserts merely that "all events in this world are fixed, or unalterable, or predetermined" (p. 8). Popper spells out an argument which, he claims, refutes scientific determinism. Even given a universe in which all events occur in accordance with a deterministic physical theory, T, nevertheless a predictor, put within an isolated system, could not predict all future states of the system with unlimited precision. Even if such a predictor had unprecedented powers to acquire knowledge of initial conditions, and make predictions using T, nevertheless it could not acquire up-to-date information about its own state, because the attempt to do so would continually alter its state. This means it would not be possible for the predictor to predict future states of the system of which it forms a part. Popper goes on to argue against metaphysical determinism.

Although full of interesting points, there are two oddities about this discussion. First, as Popper admits, his refutation of "scientific" determinism does not refute a second version of "scientific" determinism which asserts that past states of physical systems can be predicted, employing prior initial conditions and physical theory. Second, Popper ignores a rather different third version of "scientific" determinism, which asserts that the universe is such that there is a discoverable, true, physical "theory of everything", T, which is deterministic. This version of determinism deserves to be called "scientific", because T is asserted by it to be scientifically discoverable; furthermore, once discovered, T will be falsifiable, and hence, by Popper's own standards, scientific. It is curious that Popper, who is elsewhere (as we have seen) opposed to instrumentalism and in favour of realism, should here discuss at length a version of "scientific" determinism which is thoroughly instrumentalistic in character, in that it makes assertions about predictability, and should ignore a version of "scientific" determinism which is much more in keeping with scientific realism, in that it makes an assertion about the nature of the universe. This oversight seriously weakens Popper's argument for indeterminism.

1.11 Quantum Theory

Volume three of The Postscript is called Quantum Theory and the Schism in Physics (Q.T.S.P.). It is concerned with quantum theory and probability, interconnected issues which preoccupied Popper, on and off, throughout his working life.

Thus in Logik der, Popper tackled two problems concerning probability: How are probabilistic statements or theories to be interpreted? And how can probabilistic theories be falsifiable given that they are in principle "impervious to falsification"? In response to the first problem, Popper defended a version of von Mises' objective, frequency interpretation of probability. In response to the second, he insisted that probabilistic statements become falsifiable as a result of a methodological decision to treat them as falsifiable.

Logik der Forschung also devoted a chapter to problems of quantum theory. The main task is to criticize Bohr's and Heisenberg's orthodox interpretation of quantum theory (which gives equal weight to the two "complementary" pictures of particle and wave), and to provide an alternative which interprets the theory as an objective, realistic statistical theory about particles. Popper criticizes Heisenberg's interpretation of his uncertainty relations, which interprets these relations as placing restrictions on (simultaneous) measurement. Popper argues that these relations need to be interpreted as "scatter relations", restricting what can be predicted, and not what can be measured. Indeed, Popper argues, not only can we make measurements-for example, simultaneous measurements of position and momentum-that are more precise than allowed by the uncertainty relations as interpreted by Heisenberg, we need to do this in order to test these relations.
