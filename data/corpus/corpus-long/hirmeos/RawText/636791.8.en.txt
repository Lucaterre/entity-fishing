The full force of Popper's criticism is devoted, however, to the central argument of Capital-an argument which seeks to establish the inevitable downfall of capitalism and the triumph of socialism. Popper presents Marx's arguments as having three steps, only the first of which is elaborated in Capital. The first step argues that an inevitable increase in the productivity of work leads to the accumulation of more and more wealth in the ruling class, and the greater and greater poverty and misery of the working class. The second step then argues that all classes will disappear except for a small, wealthy ruling class and a large impoverished working class, this situation inevitably leading to a revolution. The third step argues that the revolution will result in the victory of the working class, which in turn will result in the withering away of the state and the creation of socialism.

Popper demonstrates that none of these steps is inevitable by showing that alternative developments are entirely possible and, in many cases, have actually happened since Marx wrote Capital. Even if there is a tendency under capitalism for the means of production and wealth to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands (as the first step assumes), the state can intervene to counteract this tendency by such means as taxation and death duties. And as far as the increasing poverty of workers is concerned, this can be counteracted by the formation of trade unions, by collective bargaining backed up by strikes. The brutal, unrestricted capitalism of Marx's time has since been transformed out of all recognition by just such interventionist methods. And Popper makes analogous, decisive points to demolish the second and third steps of Marx's argument. Even if the ruling class did become increasingly wealthy and the working class increasingly poor (as the second step assumes), this does not mean that all classes but these two would necessarily disappear, since landowners, rural workers, and a new middle class may well exist, given Marx's assumptions. And even if violence breaks out, this does not mean it would necessarily constitute the social revolution, as envisaged by Marx. And finally, even if it is granted that the workers unite and overthrow the ruling class (as the third step assumes), this does not mean that a classless society and socialism would necessarily result. It is all too easy to suppose that the new political leaders would seize and hold on to power, justifying this by exploiting and twisting the revolutionary ideology, and by invoking the threat of counter-revolutionary forces. And many other possible outcomes can be envisaged. It is in fact implausible to suppose that the victory of the working class would mean the creation of a classless society, and hence the withering away of the state. (This bald summary does not begin to do justice to the cumulative force of Popper's argument.)

Marx, as we have seen, condemned planning for socialism as Utopian; and in a sense, Popper agrees. Popper distinguishes two kinds of social planning or intervention, which he calls Utopian and piecemeal social engineering. Utopian social engineering seeks to attain an ideal social order, such as socialism, by bringing about holistic changes in society; such an approach is, Popper argues, doomed to failure. Piecemeal social engineering, by contrast, searches for and fights against "the greatest and most urgent evils of society": this is the approach that Popper advocates). Subsequently, during the course of criticizing Marx, Popper points out that piecemeal social engineering can take the form either of state intervention, or of the creation of legal, institutional checks on freedom of action. The latter is to be preferred, Popper argues, as the former carries with it the danger of increasing the power of the state

There is very much more to Popper's O.S.E. than the above indicates. Central to the book is the idea that reason is a vital component of the open society; reason being understood as "critical rationalism", arrived at by generalizing Popper's falsificationist conception of scientific method. For Popper, both scientific method and rationality need to be understood in social terms. Popper criticizes Karl Mannheim's sociology of knowledge for overlooking the "social aspect of scientific method". Popper criticizes moral historicism, oracular philosophy and the revolt against reason, and the idea that history might have a meaning (ibid., chs. 22, 24 and 25, respectively). Both volumes have extensive footnotes containing fascinating discussion of a great variety of issues tangentially related to the main argument, such as the development of ancient Greek mathematics, the problem of putting an end to war, or the proper aims of a liberal education.

Popper's fiercely polemical book has provoked much controversy. His critical onslaughts against Plato, Aristotle, Hegel and Marx have been angrily repudiated by many scholars in these fields, or, much worse, just blandly ignored.
