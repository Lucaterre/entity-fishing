Given pre-Popperian conceptions of reason, with their emphasis on proof rather than criticism (and associated plurality of ideas), the idea that the rational society is the open society is almost a contradiction in terms. There is thus a very close link between L.Sc.D., on the one hand, and O.S.E., P.H. and C.R. on the other. And the direction of argument does not go in just one direction, from L.Sc.D. to O.S.E.: it goes in the other direction as well., Popper argues that rationality, and scientific rationality as well, need to be conceived of in social and institutional terms (and the argument is echoed in P.H., in connection with a discussion about the conditions required for scientific progress to be possible). O.S.E., P.H. and C.R. illuminate and enrich the doctrines of L.Sc.D.

Above, in connection with the discussion of L.Sc.D., it was argued that Popper's falsificationism ultimately fails, because of its failure to exclude highly falsifiable but grossly ad hoc theories from science. The scientific enterprise is obliged to conjecture that the universe is more or less comprehensible, having some kind of unified dynamic structure, only those theories being tentatively accepted which satisfy (a) empirical considerations, and (b) considerations having to do with simplicity, unity, comprehensibility. As science proceeds, we improve our (conjectural) knowledge of the kind of comprehensible unity which may exist in nature; the aim of science improves, and with it the methods of science. There is, in other words, a kind of positive feedback between improving knowledge and improving aims and methods, improving knowledge about how to improve knowledge. Science adapts its nature to what it finds out about the nature of the universe (which helps to account for the almost explosive growth of scientific knowledge).

This "evolving-aims-and-methods" view of science modifies quite considerably Popper's falsificationism. When generalized, it leads to an "evolving-aims-and-methods" view of rationality which in turn modifies quite considerably Popper's critical rationalism. These modifications, if adopted, have far-reaching implications for central doctrines of Popper's L.Sc.D., O.S.E., P.H. and C.R. (see

1.10 Popper's later work

Work published by Popper after C.R., though containing much of great value, is not, perhaps, in quite the same league as that of his first four books. Much of this work restates, extends and further applies earlier ideas. Where Popper's subsequent work launches forth in new directions, these are not always well chosen. Battles against subjectivity, antirealism and physical determinism lure Popper into defending opposing views that are exaggerated, sometimes, almost to the point of absurdity. A subtle shift of perspective, of allegiance, can be discerned as we move from Popper's earlier to his later work. In his early work, Popper speaks up on behalf of humanity, on behalf of any concerned person of good will, and against those traditional "great thinkers" and "experts" who threaten to beguile us and lead us to disaster. In his later work, the allegiances have shifted; now Popper speaks up on behalf of great science and great scientists, and against fraudulent academics, mostly philosophers and social scientists.

In 1970 there appeared Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, edited by Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, the fourth volume of the proceedings of a conference on philosophy of science held in London in 1968. This volume is devoted to a comparison of the views of Thomas Kuhn and Popper on the philosophy of science, and contains contributions from Kuhn, Popper, Watkins, Toulmin, Lakatos, Feyerabend and others. In his contribution Popper praises Kuhn for having discovered normal science, science which takes some "paradigm" for granted and devotes itself to puzzle solving. Popper points out that he had himself made the same discovery over thirty years earlier, as recorded in the preface to L.Sc.D. But the normal scientist "has been badly taught. He has been taught in a dogmatic spirit: he is the victim of indoctrination". Normal science is "a danger to science and, indeed, to our civilization"

In 1972 Popper published a second collection of his essays entitled Objective Knowledge. One of the essays makes the good point that common sense tends to combine two incompatible theses: common sense realism, and the epistemological view that knowledge comes flooding into our minds via the senses, rather like water being poured into a bucket-a view which Popper dubs "the bucket theory of the mind". Popper argues that these two theses clash, and that philosophers, registering this clash, have all too often held on to the bucket theory and rejected realism. But this, Popper argues, is exactly the wrong thing to do; one should hold on to realism, and reject the bucket theory.
