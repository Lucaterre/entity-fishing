Note, again, that this criticism of Popper has nothing justificational about it whatsoever: it simply points to the drastic failure of bare falsificationism to do justice to what actually goes on in physics.

It may be objected that ad hoc rivals to NT of the kind just considered are so silly, so crackpot, that they do not deserve to be taken seriously within physics. 11 This is of course correct. The crucial point, however, is that bare falsificationism ought to be able to deliver this verdict, and this it singularly fails to do. Bare falsificationism actually declares of appropriately concocted ad hoc rivals to NT that these are better, more acceptable than NT.

But can a criticism of Popper that appeals to such silly, crackpot theories be taken seriously? I have two replies to this question. First, not all the ad hoc or aberrant variants are entirely silly. Levy's theory is perhaps an example. There are degrees of ad hocness, from the utterly crackpot and absurd, to a degree of ad hocness so slight, so questionable, in comparison, that the issue of whether the theory really is ad hoc or not may be hotly disputed by physicists themselves. (Such disputes arise especially during scientific revolutions.) This is an important point which will have a bearing on the argument of the next section. Second, it is, I submit, the very silliness of these crackpot theories that makes the above criticism of Popper so serious. If bare falsificationism favoured T 1 over T 2 , while most scientists favoured T 2 over T 1 , even though admitting that T 1 is nevertheless a good theory, almost as acceptable as T 2 , bare falsificationism would not be in such trouble. What is lethal for bare falsificationism is that it declares T 1 to be better than T 2 in circumstances where scientists themselves (and all of us) can see that T 2 is vastly superior to T 1 , T 1 being grossly ad hoc, aberrant, wholly crackpot and silly. Bare falsificationism favours theories that receive, and deserve, instant rejection: there could scarcely be a more decisive falsification of falsificationism than that.

2.4 Refutation of dressed falsificationism

Having argued thatbare falsificationism is untenable, I turn my attention now to) doctrine of dressed falsificationism. As I have mentioned, this adds on to the (1959) doctrine Popper's new "requirement of simplicity"(see section 2.2 above).

As long as there is no serious ambiguity as to what proceeding "from some simple, new, and powerful, unifying idea" means, it is at once clear that the new doctrine is able to exclude from science all the empirically successful but ad hoc, aberrant, crackpot, silly theories, of the kind discussed above. They do not proceed "from some simple â€¦ unifying idea", and are to be rejected on that account, whatever their empirical success may be, even if this empirical success is greater than accepted scientific theories.

However, adopting Popper's new "principle of simplicity" as a basic methodological principle of science has the effect of permanently excluding from science all ad hoc theories that fail to satisfy the principle, however empirically successful such theories might be if considered. This amounts to assuming permanently that the universe is such that all ad hoc theories that fail to satisfy Popper's principle of simplicity are false-granted that a basic aim of science is truth. It amounts to accepting, as a permanent item of scientific knowledge, the substantial metaphysical thesis that the universe is non-ad hoc, in the sense that all theories that fail to satisfy Popper's principle of simplicity are false, however empirically successful they might turn out to be if considered. But this, of course, clashes with Popper's criterion of demarcation: that no unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is to be accepted as a part of scientific knowledge.

If the demarcation principle is upheld, then the metaphysical thesis just indicated, asserting that the universe is non-ad hoc, remains implicit in the permanent adoption of Popper's principle of simplicity as a basic methodological principle of science. (And this is the way Popper himself seems to have conceived the matter: he says of metaphysical research programmes that they are "often held unconsciously", and "are implicit in the theories and in the attitudes and judgements of the scientists".) But in leaving the metaphysical thesis of non-ad hocness implicit in the methodological principle of simplicity, science violates an elementary requirement for rationality, already mentioned, according to which "assumptions that are substantial, influential, problematic and implicit need to be made explicit, so that they can be critically assessed and so that alternatives may be put forward and considered, in the hope that such assumptions can be improved". The non-ad hoc metaphysical assumption may, after all, be false. We may need to adopt a modified version of the assumption. It may be essential for the progress of science that this assumption is modified. Just this turns out to be the case, given certain formulations of the assumption, as we shall see below. In leaving the non-ad hoc metaphysical assumption implicit in the adoption of the methodological principle of simplicity, dressed falsificationism protects this substantial, influential and highly problematic assumption from criticism, from the active consideration of alternatives.
