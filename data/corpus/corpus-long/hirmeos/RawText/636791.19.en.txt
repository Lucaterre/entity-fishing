It is also true that, during the last 30 years, a substantial body of work has emerged on scientific method quite generally.In none of these works does one find the criticism of Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos, expressed below, or the synthesis, namely AOE, which emerges from this criticism. 8 Furthermore, the methodological views developed in the works just cited all fall to the line of criticism deployed against Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos in the present chapter. There is no space to develop this last point here: it is, however, spelled out inas far as works up to that date are concerned. One implication, then, of the present chapter is that philosophy of science took a wrong turning around 1974 when it failed to take up the line of argument spelled out here, an early version of which is to be found in Maxwell (1974).

2.2 Karl Popper

As I mentioned in the last chapter, Popper held that science proceeds by putting forward empirically falsifiable conjectures which are then subjected to severe attempts at falsification by means of observation and experiment. Scientific theories cannot be verified by experience, but they can be falsified. Once a theory is falsified, scientists have the task of developing a potentially better theory, even more falsifiable than its predecessor, at least as ostensibly empirically successful as its predecessor, and such that it is corroborated where its predecessor was falsified. In order to be accepted (tentatively) as a part of conjectural scientific knowledge, a theory must (at least) be empirically falsifiable. Non-falsifiable, metaphysical theses are meaningful, and may influence the direction of scientific research. There can even be what Popper has called "metaphysical research programmes"-programmes of research "indispensable for science, although their character is that of metaphysical or speculative physics rather than of scientific physics â€¦ more in the nature of myths, or of dreams, than of science". For Popper, metaphysical (that is, unfalsifiable) theses cannot be a part of (conjectural) scientific knowledge; such theses cannot help determine what is accepted and rejected as (conjectural) scientific knowledge, but they can influence ideas, choice of research aims and problems, in the context of scientific discovery. (For further details see

Popper defended two distinct versions of falsificationism which, echoing terminology of Maxwell (1998), I shall call bare and dressed falsificationism. According to bare falsificationism, defended in, only empirical considerations, and such things as the falsifiability of theories and degrees of falsifiability, decide what is to be accepted and rejected in science. According to dressed falsificationism, a new theory, in order to be acceptable, "should proceed from some simple, new, and powerful, unifying idea about some connection or relation (such as gravitational attraction) between hitherto unconnected things (such as planets and apples) or facts (such as inertial and gravitational mass) or new 'theoretical entities' (such as field and particles)". This "requirement of simplicity" (as Popper calls it) is in addition to anything specified in The Logic of Scientific Discovery (L.Sc.D.). In L.Sc.D. Popper does, it is true, demand of a theory that it should be as simple as possible, but Popper there identifies degree of simplicity of a theory with degree of falsifiability. (There is a second, related notion, but Popper makes clear that if the two clash it is the falsifiability notion, just indicated, which takes priority). Thus, in L.Sc.D., in requiring of an acceptable theory that it should be as simple as possible, Popper is demanding no more than that it should be as falsifiable as possible. But Popper's "requirement of simplicity" of his Conjectures and Refutations (C.R.)is wholly in addition to falsifiability. A theory of high falsifiability may not "proceed from some simple, new, and powerful unifying idea", and vice versa. We thus have two versions of falsificationism before us: bare falsificationism of, and dressed falsificationism of C.R., with the new "requirement of simplicity" added on to the 1959 doctrine.

I now give my argument for holding that neither doctrine is tenable. (I here elaborate the criticism of Popper sketched in the previous chapter.) My argument is not that Popper fails to show how theories can be verified, or rendered probable; nor is my argument that Popper fails to show how scientific theories can be falsified, in that falsification requires the verification of a low-level falsifying hypothesis (which, according to Popper, is not possible).There is nothing "justificationist", in other words, about my criticism.
