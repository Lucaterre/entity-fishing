We can use these two notions to solve the problem of ambiguity of judgement concerning the relative non-empirical merits of Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravitation. Newton's theory is simpler, but Einstein's is more unified in that it eliminates gravitation as a force, and reformulates Newton's first law so that it becomes the assertion that bodies move along geodesics in curved space-time, curvature being caused by mass, or by stress-energy-density more generally. As theoretical physics draws closer to capturing the true theory of everything, it is reasonable to expect that the totality of fundamental physical theory will become increasingly unified and complex.

So far I have stressed that terminological unity and simplicity are irrelevant when it comes to assessing unity and simplicity in a physically significant sense. In scientific practice, however, terminology is chosen so as to reflect physically significant unity and simplicity. Thus if the content of a theory exhibits certain symmetries, terminology is chosen so that it too exhibits these symmetries, so that if the theory is invariant with respect to position or orientation in space, terminology is chosen which reflects this fact. Once a theory is formulated in such "physically appropriate" terminology (as it may be called), two versions of symmetry operations arise as a result: "active" (which make changes to physical systems) and "passive" (which make corresponding changes to the description of unchanged physical systems). Granted that we formulate physical theories exclusively in such "physically appropriate" terminology, then terminological unity and simplicity comes to reflect physical unity and simplicity, and is thus, to that extent, physically significant.

What of the simplicity and unity of theories in sciences other than fundamental physics? Much needs to be said on this topic; the following brief remarks can serve only as pointers to a more adequate treatment. Solutions to the equations of fundamental physical theory, specifying precisely how increasingly complex physical systems evolve in space and time, rapidly become horrendously complex in character. In carrying out derivations, physicists invariably "simplify" results obtained by discarding variable quantities or higher order terms judged to be insignificant in the physical situations under considerations. Just this is done when NT is "derived" from Einstein's theory, or Kepler's and Galileo's laws of motion are "derived" from NT.The outcome is a range of more or less terminologically simple phenomenological laws of only approximate validity. But the simplicity is not, here, merely pragmatic, since such a law has been "approximately derived" from some fundamental physical theory formulated in a "physically appropriate" way, the "approximate derivation"

showing what the range of applicability of the law is with what degree of accuracy. Even though such laws are incompatible with the fundamental physical theory from which they have been "approximately derived", nevertheless what the "derivations" reveal is that pragmatic simplicity has been obtained by sacrificing strict derivability and precise empirical accuracy, there being nothing here to counter the underlying unity in nature postulated by fundamental physical theory (in so far as it does postulate this). Laws such as these are prevalent throughout phenomenological physics, astrophysics and parts of physical chemistry. Even where such "approximate derivations" cannot be carried through, for large parts of chemistry, and for biology, nevertheless, as I have already remarked, laws and theories of these sciences are constrained by fundamental physics, and must endeavour to be compatible with fundamental physics, at least in the qualified way just indicated in connection with phenomenological physics. Thus, much of the great explanatory power of Darwinian theory stems from the fact that it postulates mechanisms for evolution-random inheritable variation and natural selection-which are capable of designing living things able to pursue the goals of survival and reproductive success in their given environments, these mechanisms nevertheless being compatible with the purposeless cosmos depicted by physics. Biology must accord with physics in much more specific ways as well, in that the mechanisms of inheritance and development must accord with physics, and so too the multitude of processes that take place in living things.

What implications does the account of non-empirical requirements for theories, given here, have for science? How can justice be done to evolving non-empirical requirements? How is persistent preference for unified theories, even against the evidence, to be justified? I take these three problems together.

At the beginning of this chapter I demonstrated that, in physics, theories that are unified, in senses (1) and (2) at least, are persistently chosen in preference to available, empirically more successful, but disunified theories. To proceed in this way is to make the permanent assumption that the phenomena under consideration are such that all theories of these phenomena that are disunified in senses (1) and (2) are false. If physicists persistently accepted theories that postulate atoms in preference to available, empirically more successful field theories, it would be clear that physicists are thereby assuming that all field theories are false. Just the same holds for the persistent rejection of empirically more successful disunified theories.
