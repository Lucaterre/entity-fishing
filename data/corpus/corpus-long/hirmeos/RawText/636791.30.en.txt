The key notion of "approximate derivation" can be indicated by considering a particular example: the "approximate derivation" of Kepler's law that planets move in ellipses around the sun (K) from Newtonian theory (NT). The "derivation" is done in three steps. First, NT is restricted to N body systems interacting by gravitation alone within some definite volume, no two bodies being closer than some given distance, r. Second, keeping the mass of one object constant, we consider the paths followed by the other bodies as their masses tend to zero. According to NT, in the limit, these paths are precisely those specified by K for planets. In this way we recover the form of K from NT. Third, we reinterpret this "derived" version of K so that it is now taken to apply to systems like that of our solar system. (It is of course this third step of reinterpretation that introduces error: mutual gravitational attraction between planets, and between planets and the sun, ensures that the paths of planets, with masses greater than zero, must diverge, however slightly, from precise Keplerian orbits.)

Quite generally, we can say that T r-1 is "approximately derivable" from T r if and only if a theory empirically equivalent to T r-1 can be extracted from T r by taking finitely many steps of the above type, involving (a) restricting the range of application of a theory, (b) allowing some combination of variables of a theory to tend to zero, and (c) reinterpreting a theory so that it applies to a wider range of phenomena.This solution to the problem of what progress in theoretical physics means requires AOE to be presupposed; it does not work if falsificationism is presupposed. This is because the solution requires one to assume (a) that the universe is such that a yet-to-be-discovered, true theory of everything, T, exists, and (b) current theoretical knowledge can be approximately derived from T. Both assumptions, (a) and (b), are justified granted AOE; neither assumption is justifiable granted falsificationism.8. Discovery of new fundamental theories. Given falsificationism, the discovery of new fundamental physical theories that turn out, subsequently, to meet with great empirical success, is inexplicable. (One thinks here of Newton's discovery of his mechanical theory and theory of gravitation, Maxwell's discovery of classical electromagnetism, Einstein's discovery of the special and general theories of relativity, Bohr's discovery of "old" quantum theory, Heisenberg's and Schr√∂dinger's discovery of "new" quantum theory, Dirac's discovery of the relativistic quantum theory of the electron and, in more recent times, the discovery of quantum electrodynamics, the electroweak theory, quantum chromodynamics and the standard model.) Granted that a new theory is required to explain a range of phenomena, there are, on the face of it, infinitely many possibilities. In the absence of rational guidance towards good conjectures, it would seem to be infinitely improbable that anyone should, in a finite time, be able to come up with a theory that successfully predicts new phenomena. The only guidance that falsificationism can provide is to think up new theories that "proceed from some simple, new, and powerful, unifying idea", in accordance with Popper's (1963) requirement of simplicity, but this is so vague and ambiguous as to be almost useless. Famously, Popper explicitly denied that a rational method of discovery is possible at all (see. But if discovery is not rational, it becomes miraculous that good new theories are ever discovered. Scientific progress becomes all but inexplicable. AOE, by contrast, provides physics with a rational, if fallible and non-mechanical, method for the discovery of new fundamental physical theories. This method involves modifying the current best level 3 blueprint so that:

(a) the new blueprint exemplifies physicalism better than its predecessor; (b) the new blueprint promises, when made sufficiently precise to become a testable theory, to unify clashes between predecessor theories; (c) the new theory promises to exemplify the new blueprint better than the predecessor theories exemplify the predecessor blueprint.

(a), (b) and (c) provide means for assessing how good an idea for a new theory is which do not involve empirical testing (which is brought in once the new theory has been formulated). The level 4 thesis of physicalism provides continuity between the state of knowledge before the discovery of the new theory, and the state of knowledge after this discovery. Modifying the current level 3 blueprint ensures that the new theory will be incompatible with its predecessors; it will postulate new kinds of entities, forces, space-time structure, and will exhibit new symmetries. In other words, because of the hierarchical structure of AOE, there is (across revolutions) both continuity (at level 4) and discontinuity (at levels 2 and 3), something that is not possible given falsificationism. AOE provides physics with specific non-empirical tasks to perform, specific non-empirical problems to be solved, and non-empirical methods for the assessment of ideas for new theories, all of which adds up to a rational, if fallible, method of discovery. It all stems from recognizing that physicalism is a part of current scientific knowledge. The discovery of new fundamental physical theories then ceases to be inexplicable. None of this is possible granted falsificationism.
