Bayesianism might seem to reject SE, in acknowledging both prior and posteriori probabilities. But Bayesianism tries to conform to the spirit of SE as much as possible, by regarding prior probabilities as personal, subjective and non-rational, their role in theory choice being reduced as rapidly as possible by empirical testing (see. 17. What does it mean to say that U 2 is an "improvement" over U 1 , U 2 being "closer" to the true characterization of the unity of nature, T (supposing there is such a thing) than U 1 is? This problem can be solved by exploiting the solution to the problem of verisimilitude, which I have spelled out in some detail elsewhere (see). The problem of verisimilitude is this: What does it mean to say that physics makes progress towards the truth, if it advances from one false theory to another? What does it mean, in other words, to say that fundamental physical theory T 2 is closer to the truth than T 1 , if both T 2 and T 1 are false? Let T, as before, represent the truth-the true "theory of everything". Then we can say that T 2 is closer to the truth than T 1 if T approximately implies T 2 , and T 2 approximately implies T 1 , but T 1 does not approximately imply T 2. The key notion of "approximately implies" can be illustrated by means of the way Newtonian theory approximately implies Kepler's law that planets move in ellipses. There are three steps. First, Newtonian theory is restricted to systems consisting of rather few bodies that move within a finite spatial region. Second, the masses of all the bodies but one tend to zero which, in the limit, leads to the bodies of zero mass tracing out ellipses round the remaining massive body. Third, the resulting laws are reinterpreted to apply to systems of bodies such that one body (the sun) is very much more massive than all the others (the planets), these others nevertheless having masses greater than zero. (It is this third step that introduces error.) More generally, T 2 approximately implies T 1 if a theory simulating the empirical predictions of T 1 can be extracted from T 2 by means of a finite number of steps of the kind just illustrated: T 2 is restricted in scope; non-zero physical variables tend to zero; laws applicable to precise values of variables are reinterpreted to apply to a range of values of physical variables. (For more details, see the works to which I have just referred.) We can now exploit this solution to the problem of verisimilitude to explicate what it means to say that the metaphysical thesis of unity, U 2 , is closer to T than U 1. Let T 2 and T 1 be theories that accord with, or exemplify, U 2 and U 1 respectively. U 2 can be said to be closer to T than U 1 if T 2 is closer to the truth, T, than T 1 is, and there are no theories, T 2 * and T 1 *, exemplifying U 2 and U 1 respectively such that T 1 * is closer to the truth than T 2 *. 18.

What makes this possible is the feature of the hierarchy about to be indicated in the text, namely that, as one goes up the hierarchy, assumptions are more and more firmly upheld. Level 2 theories that accord with the best available level 3 assumption tend to be favoured over rivals that do not so accord. Nevertheless, a level 2 theory that clashes with the current level 3 assumption, but (a) accords with the level 4 assumption, and (b) is more empirically successful than theories that are in accord with the best level 3 assumption, will be accepted, and will lead to the rejection, or modification, of the level 3 assumption with which it clashes. Consider, however, a theory that clashes, not just with level 3, but with level 4 as well, even though it is compatible with level 5, in such a way that no version of the idea that the universe is physically comprehensible, at level 4, can be rendered compatible with the theory. Such a theory would have to meet with far greater, sustained empirical success before it led to the overthrow of the current level 4 assumption. It would have to lead to empirical research programmes across a broad front of natural science even more successful than current science, based on the current level 4 assumption, before it would become acceptable. And this would be the case even more, given a theory that clashes with the current level 5 assumption. In short, an assumption at a given level may, for much of the time, determine choices lower down in the hierarchy; but every now and again, it may itself be revised, because the revised version accords better with the assumption above or is more empirically fruitful, or, more likely, both of these simultaneously. 20. Corresponding to each cosmological thesis, at level 3 to 7, there is a more or less problematic aim for theoretical physics: to specify that cosmological thesis as a true, precise, testable, experimentally confirmed "theory of everything". The aim corresponding to level 7 is relatively unproblematic: circumstances will never arise such that it would serve the interests of acquiring knowledge to revise this aim. As one descends the hierarchy of cosmological assumptions, the corresponding aims become increasingly problematic, increasingly likely to be unrealizable, just because the corresponding assumption becomes increasingly likely to be false. Whereas upper-level aims and methods will not need revision, lower-level aims and methods, especially those corresponding to level 3, will need to be revised as science advances. Thus lower-level aims and methods evolve within the fixed framework of upper-level aims and methods. 21. Some features of AOE may seem reminiscent of Laudan's "normative naturalism" (see
