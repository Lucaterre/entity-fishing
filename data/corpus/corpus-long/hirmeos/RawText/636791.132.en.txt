There are, in short, a few scattered signs that the revolution, from specialism to universalism, or from knowledge to wisdom, is already under way. It will need, however, much wider cooperative support-from scientists, scholars, students, research councils, university administrators, vice chancellors, teachers, the media and the general public-if it is to become anything more than what it is at present, a few fragmentary, scattered changes intended to put right quite specific perceived defects in the status quo. What we need is a high-profile campaign, in the public eye, concerned to make out the case for a comprehensive revolution in our universities so they come to put universalism, or the philosophy of wisdom, into academic practice. If this revolution ever comes about it will be comparable in its long-term impact to that of the Renaissance, the scientific revolution or the Enlightenment. The outcome will be that we will at last have what we so urgently need, institutions of learning and research rationally organized and devoted to helping us realize what is of value in life-helping us make progress towards as good a world as possible.

It is important to appreciate the existence of a central backbone of argument running through these four books. In The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959), Popper argues (as we all know) that all scientific knowledge is irredeemably conjectural in character, it being impossible to verify theories empirically. Science makes progress by proposing bold conjectures in response to problems, which are then subjected to sustained attempted empirical refutation. This falsificationist conception of scientific method is then generalized to form Popper's conception of (critical) rationality, a general methodology for solving problems or making progress. As Popper puts it in The Logic of Scientific Discovery, "intersubjective testing is merely a very important aspect of the more general idea of inter-subjective criticism, or in other words, of the idea of mutual rational control by critical discussion"In order to make sense of the idea of severe testing in science, we need to see the experimentalist as having at least the germ of an idea for a rival theory up his sleeve (otherwise testing might degenerate into performing essentially the same experiment again and again). This means experiments are always crucial experiments, attempts at trying to decide between two competing theories. Theoretical pluralism is necessary for science to be genuinely empirical. And, more generally, in order to criticize an idea, one needs to have a rival idea in mind. Rationality, as construed by Popper, requires plurality of ideas, values, ways of life. Thus, for Popper, the rational society is the open society. Given pre-Popperian conceptions of reason, with their emphasis on proof rather than criticism (and associated plurality of ideas), the idea that the rational society is the open society is almost a contradiction in terms. There is thus a very close link between The Logic of Scientific Discovery, on the one hand, and The Open Society and Its Enemies, The Poverty of Historicism, and Conjectures and Refutations on the other.

And the direction of argument does not go in just one direction, from The Logic of Scientific Discovery to The Open Society and Its Enemies: it goes in the other direction as well. For in The Open Society and Its Enemies Popper argues that rationality, and scientific rationality as well, need to be conceived of in social and institutional terms(and the argument is echoed in The Poverty of Historicism, in connection with a discussion about the conditions required for scientific progress to be possible

10.2 The Enlightenment Programme

Much of the importance of Popper's first four books stems from the fact that they constitute a major contribution to what may be called "The Enlightenment Programme"-the basic idea of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, especially the French Enlightenment, of learning from scientific progress how to achieve social progress towards an enlightened world.Popper's work does much to revitalize and improve on the version of the Enlightenment Programme that we have inherited from the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, from Voltaire, Diderot, Condorcet and the other philosophes. 3 But, as we shall see-and this is the main point of this chapter-Popper's version of the Enlightenment Programme, despite its great virtues, is still defective, and needs further improvement.

But before I discuss Popper's contribution, I want first to say a few words about how profoundly important the basic Enlightenment idea is of learning from scientific progress how to achieve social progress towards an enlightened world.
