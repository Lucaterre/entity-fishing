Science has made astonishing progress in improving knowledge. But social progress towards an enlightened world seems much more problematic. This discrepancy would be reason enough to take very seriously indeed the Enlightenment idea of seeing whether we can learn from scientific progress how to achieve greater social progress towards an enlightened world. But what makes this Enlightenment idea so much more important and urgent, for our times, is that all too often, and tragically, modern science and technology have actually been implicated in some of our worst human disasters. Modern science and technology have undoubtedly done much to help relieve human suffering and enhance the quality of human life; but there is still our terrible record of unnecessary human suffering and death, our record of man-made disasters during the past hundred years or so: horrifyingly destructive wars; the terrifying threat posed by modern armaments, conventional, chemical, biological and nuclear; vast inequalities in wealth around the globe; explosive population growth; the destruction of natural habitats and the rapid extinction of species; pollution of earth, sea and air, the latter leading to the impending devastation of climate change. And a crucial point to note about these global problems is that they have been made possible, have even, in a perfectly legitimate sense, been caused, 4 by the advent of modern science and technology. Without the amazing success of modern science and technology, they would not have happened. There is nothing surprising about this. New scientific knowledge and technological know-how enormously increase our power to act: in the absence of enlightenment, of wisdom, our new power to act will sometimes have good consequences, but will also, as often as not, have bad consequences, whether intended, as in war, or unintended, as in global warming. Before the advent of modern science, lack of wisdom, of enlightenment, did not matter too much; we lacked the power to do too much damage to ourselves and the planet. But now that we do have modern science, and the unprecedented powers that it has given us, lack of enlightenment puts us into a position of unprecedented peril. It may even be that our very survival depends on humanity learning a bit more wisdom. Instead of blaming science for our troubles, as many do, we need, rather, to see whether we can learn from the astonishing and dangerous success of science about how to acquire a bit more global wisdom.

The eighteenth-century philosophes interpreted the basic Enlightenment idea as requiring that the social sciences be developed alongside the natural sciences. Francis Bacon had already argued that, in order to better the lot of humanity, it is essential to improve our knowledge of the natural world. The philosophes, understandably enough, came to the conclusion that, in order to make social progress it is, if anything, even more important to improve knowledge of the social world. So they set about creating and developing the social sciences: economics, psychology, history, anthropology, sociology, political science. This was continued throughout the nineteenth century by such men as Saint-Simon, Comte, Mill and Marx until, by the mid-twentieth century, departments of these various social sciences, as conceived of by the eighteenth century, had been created in universities all over the world.It is hardly too much to say that academic inquiry, as it exists today, is the outcome of developing and institutionalizing the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, and the Enlightenment Programme of the eighteenth century.

The Enlightenment was of course opposed by the Romantic movement. This put its faith in emotion, imagination, spontaneity, inspiration, art, genius, and opposed the Enlightenment faith in science and reason. This Romantic opposition to the Enlightenment, to science and reason, is still influential today in such fields as politics, education, anti-science movements, the arts. And it is still influential in some parts of academic inquiry, in such areas as philosophy, cultural studies, anthropology. Postmodernism comes out of the Romantic movement.But in objecting to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism entirely missed the point. For the Traditional Enlightenment, inherited from the eighteenth century, suffers, not from too much reason, but from not enough. It amounts to a characteristic kind of irrationality masquerading as rationality. In developing the basic Enlightenment idea intellectually, the philosophes botched the job; and unfortunately it is this botched, irrational version of the Enlightenment Programme that we now have built into the intellectual and institutional structure of the academic enterprise. Academic inquiry today, when judged from the standpoint of helping us create a better world, is damagingly irrational in a wholesale, structural way.There are three steps that need to be got right to put the basic Enlightenment idea into practice correctly:

(i) The progress-achieving methods of science need to be correctly identified. (ii) These methods need to be correctly generalized so that they become fruitfully applicable to any worthwhile, problematic human endeavour, whatever the aims may be, and not just applicable to the endeavour of improving knowledge. (iii) The correctly generalized progress-achieving methods then need to be exploited correctly in the great human endeavour of trying to make social progress towards an enlightened, civilized world.
