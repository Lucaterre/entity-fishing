Fourth, there are grounds for holding that Einstein's fundamental problem soon after 1900 was the type (4) blueprint problem I have just indicated-the problem of understanding how charged point particles can interact with the field, or the problem of unifying point particle and field. It is a striking fact that Einstein's three great papers of 1905 can all be interpreted as exploring aspects of this fundamental problem. We have just seen that this is true of the paper introducing special relativity. It is also true of the Brownian motion paper, concerned to establish the existence of atoms-the existence of the particle-like aspect of reality. And it is true above all of the paper which put forward the idea that light has a particle-like aspect in accordance with E = nhν (where E is the energy and ν the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant and n is some integer, the number of light quanta present), this "heuristic" hypothesis of light quanta then being used to explain the photoelectric effect. Here the classical particle/ field problem is intensified to an extraordinary extent in that the field itself is revealed to have a particle-like aspect.As it happens, Einstein himself makes clear in his "Autobiographical Notes") that he held the classical particle/ field problem to be of fundamental importance. 11 Having explained that theories are to be critically assessed from the two distinct standpoints of empirical success and "inner perfection" (unity or comprehensibility)-which in itself commits Einstein to aim-oriented empiricism (see below)-he goes on to assess critically Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics from the standpoint of inner perfection. We have here, incidentally, an adjunct to, and refinement of, Einstein's method of discovery: one theory is here taken at a time, and is assessed from the standpoint of "inner perfection"-from the standpoint, that is, of the capacity of the theory to provide a "perfect" blueprint for all of physics as far as the form of the theory is concerned. (In indicating the "inner perfection" defects of a theory, one in effect indicates, at least in general terms, what would constitute a "perfect" theory: one indicates, that is, a blueprint.) Einstein discusses six "inner perfection" defects in Newtonian mechanics, namely: (1) arbitrariness in the determination of inertial reference frames from an infinity of alternatives, and inadequacy of introducing absolute space (with respect to which all bodies have absolute acceleration as a solution to this problem); (2) two distinct basic laws (and not one), namely: (a) the law of motion (F = ma), and (b) the expression for force or potential energy (F = Gm 1 m 2 / d 2 ); (3) arbitrariness of (b) given (a), there being endlessly many equally good possibilities for (b) given (a); (4) the possibility of the force law being determined by the structure of space (the form of the force law being suggestively simple when viewed in geometrical terms), and yet the failure to exploit this possibility; (5) the ad hoc character of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass; and (6) unnaturalness of energy being split into two forms, kinetic and potential (see. As far as electrodynamics is concerned, Einstein discerns one basic defect associated with interpreting the field equations as applying to matter and, in the case of the vacuum, to the aether. Einstein argues (perhaps not altogether accurately) that this defect was overcome by Lorentz in reinterpreting the field equations to hold essentially only for the vacuum, with matter, in the form of charged particles, being the source of the field. Einstein then remarks: "If one views this phase of the development of theory critically, one is struck by the dualism which lies in the fact that the material point in Newton's sense and the field as continuum are used as elementary concepts side by side". Einstein explains why attempts to overcome this basic defect by eliminating the point particle do not succeed; and he concludes: "Accordingly, the revolution begun by the introduction of the field was by no means finished. Then it happened that, around the turn of the century … a second fundamental crisis set in" (ibid., italics mine)-namely the crisis engendered by the first step towards quantum theory, Planck's quantum explanation of his empirical radiation law. If this is the second fundamental crisis, then the first is particle/ field dualism of classical physics. As it happens, the two crises are intimately interrelated, since Planck's law and quantum theory deal with the interaction of field and matter. There are good grounds, then, for holding that Einstein was concerned with problems from type (2) to type (5), as defined above, and type (1) problems where relevant, a type (4) problem of special concern to Einstein being the problem of how to unify point particles and field.
