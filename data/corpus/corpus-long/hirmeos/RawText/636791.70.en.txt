In assessing the relative fruitfulness of two rival metaphysical theses, M a and M b , for some phase in the development of theoretical physics that involves the successive acceptance of theories T 1 , T 2 , … T n , two considerations need to be born in mind. First, how potentially fruitful are M a and M b , how specific or precise, and thus how specific in the guidelines offered for the development of new theories? Second, how actually fruitful are M a and M b , in the sense of how successful or unsuccessful has the succession of theories, T 1 , T 2 , … T n , been when regarded as a research programme with M a or M b as its key idea? When both considerations are taken into account, physicalism(8) comes out as more fruitful for theoretical physics from Newton to today than any rival thesis (at its level of generality). Physicalism

is not as specific as physicalism

, and thus not as potentially fruitful; it does not do justice to the way GR absorbs the force of gravitation into the nature of space-time, and does not do justice to current research programmes which seek to unify matter and space-time. (All of physicalism(n), n = 1, 2, … 7, are scientifically fruitful to some extent, but decreasingly so as n goes down from 7 to 6 … to 1, in view of the decreasing specificity and content of these versions of physicalism.)

The notion of "research programme" appealed to here is similar to, but not the same as, the notion developed by. The main differences are as follows. For Lakatos, the "hard core" of a research programme was a testable theory rendered metaphysical by a methodological decision; the main research activity associated with a research programme involved developing successful applications of the theory, guided by the "positive heuristic" stemming from the "hard core". (In all this, Lakatos followed Kuhn's conception of "normal science", giving Lakatosian terms to Kuhnian ideas [see.) In the text, I have assumed that the metaphysics of a research programme is authentic, inherently untestable metaphysics, the main research task being to develop a succession of theories that progressively capture the metaphysics more and more successfully. The account of "degrees of disunity" given in section 5.3 above provides a precise way of assessing the extent to which successive "totalities of fundamental physical theory" do, or do not, increasingly successfully capture physicalism. Thus, given such a succession, T 1 , T 2 , … T m , with degrees of disunity N 1 , N 2 , … N m , of type (5-7), with N 1 > N 2 > … > N m , then T 1 , T 2 , … T m do progressively capture physicalism(5-7) more and more successfully. There is nothing like this in the Lakatosian account of research programme, lacking as it does the solution to the problem of unity of theory. Finally, there is a substantial difference in the intended application of the two notions. Whereas I see science as a whole as one gigantic research programme, the hierarchy of versions of physicalism being presupposed as the metaphysical "hard core", it is essential to Lakatos's quasi-Popperian conception of science that science is made up of competing research programmes. This means that, for Lakatos, science cannot be viewed as one gigantic Lakatosian research programme (since, if it were, there could be no competitor). Lakatos does say, it is true, "Even science as a whole can be regarded as a huge research programme with Popper's supreme heuristic rule: 'devise conjectures which have more empirical content than their predecessors' ". But there is here no overall Lakatosian "hard core" or "positive heuristic". This is Popper's conception of science and, for Lakatos, his own conception of research programme is strictly inapplicable to science as a whole. (For a more detailed comparison and critical assessment of the two views, see Chapter 2, section 2.8).Some philosophers of science hold that the successive revolutions in theoretical physics that have taken place since Galileo or Newton make it quite impossible to construe science as steadily and progressively honing in on some definite view of the natural world. If attention is restricted to standard empiricism and physical theory, this may be the case. But the moment some form of presuppositionism is accepted, and one considers metaphysical theses implicit in the methods of science, a very different conclusion emerges: all theoretical revolutions since Galileo exemplify the one idea of unity in nature. Far from obliterating the idea that there is a persistent thesis about the nature of the universe in physics, as Kuhn and Laudan suppose, all theoretical revolutions, without exception, do exactly the opposite in revealing that theoretical physics draws ever closer to capturing the idea that there is an underlying dynamic unity in nature, as specified by physicalism
