Other families had a different attitude and preserved their private narratives, letters and pictures hidden at the bottom of the chest 񮽙 : "round the s I received a letter from my elder sister from Shenehen. She sent me a picture of my mother and my sister's daughter Tuya

who was born there. But I could not read it, because it was written in old Mongolian script. In Soyuz [the Soviet Union] we learned Cyril writing [Cyrillic script].

In Mongolian nomadic culture a chest (khanza) was a piece of transportable furniture provided with a length of adult dress (degel), where family keep all seasonal cloth and other valuable belongings. In this type of usage of the chest acquired an additional allegorical character linked with chronology and layers of memory. Upper layers contain everyday objects which are more often in use. Deeper strata often hide more precious and personally valuable things.

I heard that one repressed lama returned from gulag prison back to Tsogto-Khangil [a neighbouring village about km away]. Only he could read my letter, because other people couldn't read old Mongolian script. So one evening I rode my horse to his house. He read it to me, but also said not to show this letter to anybody and to burn it. I did not burn it and kept it at the bottom of my chest (khanza. I also kept some other letters that I received through peoplees hands from time to time, but I was afraid to show them to anyone. Even if I couldn't read them, anyway I was happy, that they remembered me, that they were alive and in good condition. I embraced the letter, cried, stroked the pages with my hand, and dreamed as if we were all together again, as if I went to see her over the border to Shenehen, as if she came to see me. When my sister came to nutag from China in the s for the first time after years to visit me

, with her daughter Tuya, I opened my chest, took out her letters and asked her to read all of them, that she had written to me in the last twenty years Sanjit, years old, "ginskoye, Russia, .

The border-crossing regime in the late Soviet period, especially the Soviet-Mongolian part of the border, was relaxed compared to the Soviet-Chinese border, which remained strictly sealed until the end of the s. Some people were allowed to cross the border, but not everyone.

There were a number of special Soviet-Mongolian border regulations, which infiltrated categories of people who could cross into the frame of the official Soviet-Mongolian friendship treaties. "lexei Yurchak raises the question: what was the nature of the late Soviet system and way of life that had this paradox at its core? Exploring the period between mid-s and the mid-s, he criticises the prevailing binary characterisation of Soviet life produced in the west and later in the former Soviet Union and responds to the earlier argument of Susan, that in these societies, … [r]ather than any clear-cut 'us' versus 'them' or 'private' versus 'public', there was a ubiquitous self-embedding or interweaving of these categories.

But he also comments on their underlying assumption that socialism was based on a complex web of immoralitiesclaim that … everyone to some extent [was]complicit in the system of patronage, lying, theft, hedging and duplicity of thought which the system operated', and that often even intimates, family members and friends informed on each other Yurchak. Caroline Humphrey pointed out that the state and state institutions in socialism were not defined as separate from the people or the public sphere, but incorporated everyone, top to bottom, through complex, multiple, and shifting nesting hierarchies consecutively embedded like Russian dolls. The following stories present vivid examples of what kind of immoralities people had to face if they wanted to visit a homeland across the border, and how relations based on ethnicity and kinship needed to be hidden and concealed. It was a common practice in the Soviet block states to set up brother capitals, brother towns and even brother state farms. Uzon village, officially named kolhoz Voroshilova, 10 was considered to be one of the best and most progressivee Rus. peredovoi) collective farms in the Chita region. The Mongolian village across the border, "ayan-Uul, became a brother collective farm. In this official partnership the Mongolian village was the menteee Rus. podshefnyi) while the village from the Soviet side acted as the mentor patronising partner Rus. shefskii) in the official discourse of Soviet-Mongolian relations. Ironically, Bayan-Uul, a hundred kilometers away from Uzon, had been established by Buriad emigrants who had fled from Uzon and the neighboring villages Tokchin and Alhanai. In official discourse, these brother state farms were local symbols of Soviet-Mongolian friendship, and examples of how Soviets provided economic and social help to Mongols. But in private and individual discourse Mongols from the Mongolian side and Soviets from the Russian side were all connected within a net of related kin groups. To illustrate how official, private and individual categories were mixed at the local level, I use the story of a retired Communist Party functionary, Lodoi, who was the Chairman of the Uzon collective farm during the-s
