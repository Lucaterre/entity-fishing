Propensiton quantum theory (PQT), as we may call this micro-realistic, fundamentally probabilistic version of quantum theory, can recover all the experimental success of OQT. This follows from four points. First, OQT and PQT use the same dynamical equation, namely Schrödinger's timedependent equation. Second, whenever a position measurement is made, and a quantum system is detected, this invariably involves the creation of a new "particle" (bound or stationary system, such as the ionization of an atom or the dissociation of a molecule, usually millions of these). This means that whenever a position measurement is made, the conditions for probabilistic transitions to occur, according to PQT, are satisfied. PQT will reproduce the predictions of OQT (given that PQT is provided with a specification of the quantum state of the measuring apparatus). Third, all other observables of OQT, such as momentum, energy, angular momentum or spin, always involve (i) a preparation procedure which leads to distinct spatial locations being associated with distinct values of the observable to be measured, and (ii) a position measurement in one or other spatial location. This means that PQT can predict the outcome of measurements of all the observables of OQT. Fourth, in so far as the predictions of OQT and PQT dier, the dierence is extraordinarily dicult to detect, and will not be detectable in any quantum measurement so far performed.

In principle, however, OQT and PQT yield predictions that diier for experiments that are extraordinarily diicult to perform, and which have not yet, to my knowledge, been performed. Consider the following evolution:

Suppose the experimental arrangement is such that, if the superposition at stage (3) persists, then interference effects will be detected at stage (5). Suppose, now, that at stage (3) the condition for the superposition to collapse into one or other state, according to PQT, obtains. In these circumstances, OQT predicts interference at stage (5), whereas PQT predicts no interference at stage (5) (assuming the above evolution is repeated many times). PQT predicts that in each individual case, at stage (3), the superposition collapses probabilistically into one or other state. Hence there can be no interference.

8.3 Further questions

It may be asked how ψ(t) can possibly represent the real physical state of a quantum system given that ψ(t) is a complex function of space and time. The answer is that ψ(t) can always be construed to depict two real functions of space and time.

It may be asked how ψ(t) can possibly represent the real physical state of a quantum system consisting of two (or more) quantum entangled "particles", since in this case ψ(t) is a function of six-dimensional configuration space plus time (or, in general, a function of 3N configuration space plus time, where N is the number of quantum entangled "particles" that go to make up the system in question). In the case of two "particles", we can construe ψ(r 1 , r 2 , t), where r 1 and r 2 are the spatial coordinates of "particles" 1 and 2 respectively, as depicting the propensity state of the system in real 3-dimensional physical space, as follows. |ψ(r 1 , r 2 , t)| 2 dV 1 dV 2 represents the probability of the system interacting in a localizing (wave-packet-collapsing) way such that "particle" 1 interacts in volume element dV 1 about spatial coordinates r 1 , and "particle" 2 interacts in volume element dV 2 about spatial coordinates r 2. The quantum entangled nature of the system means that as r 2 is changed, so the probability of "particle" 1 interacting in dV 1 about r 2 will, in general, change too.

It may be objected that postulate 1(A+B) provides no mechanism for quantum systems to be localized. This is not correct. If a highly localized system, S 1 , interacts inelastically with a highly unlocalized system, S 2 , in such a way that a probabilistic transition occurs, then S 1 will localize S 2. If an atom or nucleus emits a photon which travels outwards in a spherical shell, and which is subsequently absorbed by a localized third system, the localization of the photon will localize the emitting atom or nucleus with which it was quantum entangled.

Postulate 1(A+B) above has been formulated for rearrangement collisions. But the postulate is intended to apply to inelastic interactions that lead to the creation (or annihilation) of new particles, as in interactions such as e-+ e + → 2γ. Such interactions require that one employs relativistic QT, which is beyond the scope of the present chapter. It deserves to be noted, however, that the root idea that probabilistic transitions occur when new "particles" are created can be interpreted in a number of different ways:
