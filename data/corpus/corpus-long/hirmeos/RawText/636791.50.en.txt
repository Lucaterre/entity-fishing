excludes the possibility of quantum gravity and quantum cosmology, since these would require measuring instruments, described in terms of CP, to exist outside space-time and beyond the cosmos, and clearly this is not possible. (These are points I have developed over a number of years: see, and especially 1988, pp. 1-8.)These six gross defects, especially (i) to (iv), ensure that OQT + CP is unacceptable as a fundamental physical theory. OQT + CP cannot justifiably be held to be part of theoretical scientific knowledge. (OQT + CP encompasses a great deal of empirical knowledge, but cannot be said to be an acceptable theory, constituting theoretical knowledge.) OQT + CP is as unacceptable as the absurd, empirically successful but grossly aberrant theories considered in previous chapters. In practice this point is beyond dispute. The vast majority of physicists, from soon after 1926 down to the present day (or down to 1993, when a version of this chapter was first published), have regarded OQT as an entirely acceptable part of scientific knowledge: they have been able to do this because they have been able to pretend that OQT + CP is really just OQT. In almost all the textbooks and physical journals, quantum theory is treated as if its postulates are purely quantum mechanical ones. As a result, OQT appears to be thoroughly non-ad hoc, precise and explanatory, as conceptually coherent and unified as any classical theory. But all this is an illusion. It is the outcome of pretending that the physical theory-the theory that has physical content-is OQT rather than OQT + CP. No such thing is possible. OQT, devoid of CP, has no physical content whatsoever. Only an all-pervasive intellectual dishonesty makes it possible to pretend that OQT alone has physical content (or that OQT + CP is really, somehow, just OQT).

All this demonstrates just how sound Einstein's instincts were when he judged OQT to be an unacceptable theory. How unerringly correct Einstein was to declare that Bohr and company "do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality"; and how sound his comparison is between OQT and "the system of delusions of an exceedingly intelligent paranoiac, concocted of incoherent elements of thoughts", namely QT and CP! It is important to appreciate that the above six defects of OQT, even though consequences of the impossibility of interpreting OQT realistically, are not defects that only realists will recognize. Any physicist, whether realist or instrumentalist, aim-oriented empiricist or standard empiricist ought, in practice, to regard the above defects as sufficient grounds for finding OQT unacceptable.We have here, in effect, an additional general argument against instrumentalism and for realism. Any fundamental physical theory, and not just OQT, which is interpreted instrumentalistically as predicting only the (observable) outcomes of measurements will be, in the same way, unacceptably (i) ad hoc, (ii) imprecise, and (iv) non-explanatory. In other words, theoretical unity implies realism; anti-realism, built into a physical theory (as it is built into OQT) must inevitably, at some point, lead to unacceptable ad hocness or aberrance (see, where this argument is spelled out in more detail).

Even though it is not essential to be an aim-oriented empiricist in order to find OQT unacceptable, it helps. For aim-oriented empiricism provides a clear and cogent raison d'être for finding OQT unacceptable even though the theory has met with such outstanding empirical success. Standard empiricism, on the other hand, can provide no such raison d'être. If scientific theories ought in the end to be judged solely on the basis of empirical success and failure, then there can be no rational grounds for rejecting OQT, given its immense, its unprecedented, empirical success.

It is in just this way that most of Einstein's contemporaries tended to view his rejection of OQT: as the outcome of unscientific, metaphysical prejudice, or even as an indication of "senility" (as Einstein himself put it). Even Abraham Pais, so knowledgeable about, and so sympathetic towards Einstein, nevertheless regards Einstein's objections to OQT as "unfounded"

Einstein's attitude towards OQT, so strikingly at odds with most of his contemporaries, provides further evidence in support of my contention that aim-oriented empiricism is implicit in Einstein's scientific work. If Einstein had assessed OQT in purely standard empiricist terms, he could have had no rational grounds for rejecting OQT-no grounds even for rejecting OQT as a "point of departure" (since this is an epistemological judgement, to the effect that OQT is fundamentally false).

From the standpoint of standard empiricism, Einstein's implacable opposition to OQT is just plain irrational prejudice. From the standpoint of aim-oriented empiricism, however, Einstein's rejection of OQT emerges as entirely well founded, scientific, rational and objective. OQT is entirely acceptable from the standpoint of empirical considerations, but unacceptable from the equally important standpoint of theoretical unity, comprehensibility. The scandal is that the majority of contemporary physicists do not see this obvious point-or did not, until quite recently.
