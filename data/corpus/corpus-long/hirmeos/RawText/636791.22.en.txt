Dressed falsificationism fails, in other words, for good Popperian reasons: it is inconsistent, in that the untestable, metaphysical thesis that the universe is non-ad hoc is accepted implicitly as a part of conjectural scientific knowledge, in conflict with the principle of demarcation; and it lacks rigour, in that it protects this implicit, metaphysical assumption from explicit criticism within the intellectual domain of science.

Here again, it should be noted, there is nothing justificationist about this criticism of Popper's dressed falsificationism. On the contrary, what the argument shows is that dressed falsificationism protects a substantial, influential, problematic but implicit assumption from criticism within science: Popper's doctrine fails for the good Popperian reason of restricting criticism.

It may be objected that adopting Popper's methodological principle of simplicity does not commit science to making a substantial metaphysical assumption about the universe-namely that it is such that no falsifiable theory, however empirically successful, which fails to satisfy the principle, is true. But I do not see how such an objection can be valid. Suppose, instead of adopting Popper's principle, science adopted the principle that in order to be acceptable, a new physical theory must postulate that the universe is made up of atoms. This methodological principle is upheld in such a way that even though theories are available which postulate fields rather than atoms, and which are much more empirically successful than any atomic theory, nevertheless these rival field theories are all excluded from science. Would it not be clear that science, in adopting and implementing the methodological principle of atomicity in this way, is making the assumption that the universe is made up of atoms, whether this is acknowledged or not? How can this be denied? Just the same holds if science adopts and implements Popper's methodological principle of simplicity.

Popper might have tried to wriggle out of accepting this conclusion by pointing to the fact that he only declared that a new theory, in order to be acceptable, "should" proceed from some simple, unifying idea. It is desirable, but not essential, that new theories should satisfy this principle. The principle is relevant to the context of discovery, perhaps, but not to the context of acceptance and rejection. (It is a heuristic principle, not a methodological one.) But if Popper's doctrine is interpreted in this way, it immediately fails to overcome the objections spelled out in section 2.3 above. Either falsificationism adopts Popper's principle of simplicity as a methodological principle, or it does not. If it does, it encounters the objections just indicated; if it does not, it encounters the objections of section 2.3.

2.5 From falsificationism to aim-oriented empiricism

The conclusion to be drawn from the argument of the last two sections is that science is more rational, more intellectually rigorous, if it makes explicit, as a criticizable tenet of (conjectural) scientific knowledge, that substantial, influential and problematic metaphysical thesis which is implicit in the way physics persistently rejects ad hoc theories, however empirically successful they may be.At once two important new problems leap to our attention. What, precisely, does this metaphysical thesis assert? And on what grounds is it to be (conjecturally) accepted as a part of scientific knowledge?

As far as the first of the above two problems is concerned, a wide range of metaphysical theses are available. As I indicated in section 2.3 above, ad hoc theories range from the utterly crackpot and silly, to theories that are only somewhat lacking in simplicity or unity. At one extreme, we might adopt a metaphysical thesis that excludes only utterly silly theories; at the other extreme, we might adopt the thesis that the universe is physically comprehensible in the sense that it has a unified dynamic structure, some yet-to-be-discovered unified physical "theory of everything" being true-a thesis that I shall call "physicalism". We might even adopt some specific version of physicalism, which asserts that the underlying physical unity is of a specific type: it is made up of a unified field perhaps, or a quantum field, or empty topologically complex curved space-time, or a quantum string field. Other things being equal, the more specific the thesis (and thus the more it excludes) so the more likely it is to be false, whereas the more unspecific it is so the more likely it is to be true. It is not, it seems, at all clear what metaphysical thesis we should take science to be presupposing.

As far as the second of the above two problems is concerned, it could be argued that grounds for accepting the metaphysical conjecture of physics (whatever precisely it may be) come from the fact that physics inevitably accepts this conjecture in persistently accepting unified theories in preference to empirically more successful disunified rivals, and it is more rigorous to acknowledge the conjecture than to disavow it. No more is required to render acceptance of the conjecture rational. But this is hardly satisfactory. It would always be possible to formulate an aberrant version of the metaphysical conjecture-a version which asserts that the universe exhibits lawful unity until the year 2090, let us say, when quite different physical laws will begin to operate. If this conjecture is accepted, physical theories would be accepted which would be quite different from the ones we do accept, but nevertheless just as empirically successful (until 2090 at least). There does need to be some reason for accepting the unified metaphysical conjecture we do implicitly accept, in preference to aberrant versions of this conjecture-a reason more substantial than "this conjecture is implicit in what theoretical physicists actually do".
