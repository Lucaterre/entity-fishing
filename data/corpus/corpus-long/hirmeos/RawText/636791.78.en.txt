Finally, though the aesthetic induction might one day favour some particular metaphysical world view, so far this has not happened

6.3 Comparison of the two views

What is rather astonishing about aim-oriented empiricism (AOE) and MAI is that, though arrived at independently, and though giving what are, in some respects, very different pictures of the scientific enterprise, nevertheless the two views have much in common. Both seek to uphold what McAllister calls "the rationalist image of science". Both hold that (some) criteria of theory choice can be justified by an appeal to the aims of science. Both hold that non-empirical criteria of theory choice have an enormously important part to play in science. Both hold that these nonempirical criteria are, in practical applications, quite diverse in character. Both hold that they change over time, as science progresses. And there is considerable agreement as to what these non-empirical criteria are: simplicity, unity, symmetry and compatibility with some metaphysical world view, are all important, for both views.

Both hold that these criteria apply, not to specific formulations of theories, but to what all possible formulations have in common. And both give accounts of scientific revolutions that differ substantially from Kuhn's account.

But there are also dramatic differences. MAI is, for McAllister, "a medium-level model of scientific practice, of a scope intermediate between the loftiest generalization and the historical study". AOE is put forward as a "highest-level model", with implications and applications for all of natural science. (Strictly speaking, it is what I call "generalized AOE"embodying the hierarchical structure of AOE, but lacking specific, lower-level theses of AOE-that is a model at the highest level, applying to science throughout history; AOE is restricted to postGalilean science.)

Again, MAI is a version of standard empiricism (SE), whereas AOE emphatically rejects SE. That MAI is a version of SE is clear from the way the aim of science is characterized as "empirical adequacy". It is also apparent in the way science can, according to MAI, establish a metaphysical world view. This can only happen via the aesthetic induction, and has not as yet come about. According to AOE, by contrast, at levels 7 and 6 there are metaphysical, cosmological theses that are permanently accepted by science, and at levels 5 to 3, there are metaphysical theses which are a part of current scientific knowledge, but which are increasingly likely to require revision with the advance of science, as one descends from level 5 to level 3 (see

.1 in Chapter 2).

Whereas MAI gives to science just one aim (empirical adequacy), AOE sees science as having a hierarchy of aims, from empirical adequacy, perhaps, at the highest level, down to the aim to turn the best available level 3 blueprint into a precise, true theory of everything, at the lowest level. (And even more specific, and different, aims are assigned to different branches of natural science.)

That AOE postulates this hierarchical structure to the aims of science, whereas MAI does not, leads to different treatments of changing criteria for theory choice. According to MAI, criteria of theory choice are of two kinds: those that are justified by an appeal to the basic aim of science (empirical adequacy), and those that are justified by inductive projection-the aesthetic criteria arrived at by the aesthetic induction. These latter are weaker than the former, and presuppose, for logical reasons, the former (McAllister, 1996, p. 76). According to AOE, by contrast, all criteria of theory choice are arrived at by aim analysis: those that evolve do so because the level 3 aim of science evolves.

Even though MAI and AOE agree that non-empirical criteria of theory choice change with time, they disagree about which criteria change, and what this change involves. According to AOE, something close to physicalism has been implicit in the methods of theoretical physics since Galileo or Newton; the demand for theoretical unity, associated with physicalism, has been more or less unchanging. What has changed is the form that the demand for unity takes, as manifest in dramatically changing level 3 metaphysical blueprints. MAI does not claim that physicalism, and the requirement of unity associated with it, is a part of the unchanging criteria of theory choice (since Galileo, at least). Nor could MAI claim this, as long as it is a version of SE.

According to AOE, the level 4 thesis of physicalism, and the level 3 best metaphysical blueprint, are arrived at by a quasi-Popperian process of conjecture and criticism, the whole direction of progress in theoretical physics since the birth of modern science (or since the Presocratics) being taken into account. The claim is that these theses make explicit what theoretical physics hopes to achieve: they are intended to be the best conjectures as to what the basic aims of theoretical physics should be, at different levels of specificity. These theses are intended to lead to criteria, to methodological principles such as symmetry principles, that will be relevant for future theories, not yet developed. Indeed, according to AOE, the activity of further articulating the best blueprint, and solving problems of unity to which it gives rise, provides science with a rational, if fallible method of discovery.
