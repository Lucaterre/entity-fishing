This, I suggest, has an important resonance for the ways in which speakers conceptualise the border and it may help understand the customary visualisation by Russians of the border as a national and ethnic fault line susceptible to be crossed and requiring protection 񮽙 (see Humphrey, this volume), while the Chinese imagine it as a more supple zone, at times rich in opportunities, at other times as regions of danger.

The formation of the Chinese state has often been described as a process of gradual expansion outwards, slowly incorporating lands on its margins Fairbank , Tu in a process of Sinicisation or cooking of surrounding barbarian groups Fiskesjö. From a cultural centre located in the North China Plain, China is perceived to exist at the centre of an ever-widening series of concentric borderlands Potter. The centre, or coree, noted Sinologist Owen Lattimore-, was known as central plainn zhongyuan 中原 or inner Chinaa neidi 内地) and referred to the densely populated, ethnic Han region running from north to south along the coast. The periphery, also known as frontiers bianjiang 边疆 or outer Chinaa waidi 外地), enveloped this Han heartland to the north, west, and southwest.

While the process of Sinicisation is somewhat problematic since it assumes a unidirectional transformation and assimilation (Crossley, Siu and Sutton "illé , what interests me here is the assumed survival of this model. In fact, a large share of anxieties about China gravitates precisely around this idea, namely that China continues to perceive itself as a cultural centre radiating outwards, and that formal demarcation (and resolution) of her national borders continues to exist in parallel with an ever-advancing cultural front.

Earlier, I defined borders as the territorial limits of a nation state and frontiers as the process of expansion of a political entity. Ethnographic data from various parts of the world, like South-East "sia Carsten or Europe Wilson and Donnan-suggest that nations were defined historically by their centres and that they articulated on ties of fealty between persons, not on the unambiguous mapping out of spacee Carsten. It is only later, as nations expanded and unclaimed lands shrank, that attempts were made to resolve these difficulties by delimiting a precise boundary Prescott. 10 From a people-based understanding, what was then witnessed was a gradual territorialisationn of the state Sahlins , i.e. a decline in relationships-inflected views of the nation and a progressive isomorphic identification between the physical and cultural extent of the state.

Traditionally, China's views of her borderlands were predominantly negative: borderlands were places of banishment as well as spaces generating cycles of crisis and catastrophe Woodside-. "ut if these territories formally included within the nation were seen, and frequently continue to be seen, as not quite Chinese and peopled by nonHan groups, the misalignment between political boundaries and cultural frontiers also has a formative impact on common perceptions of territories lying outside the current borders of the PRC. Regions such as Mongolia or parts of the Russian Far East, notably the Maritime region (Primorskii Krai), are not considered Chinese yet remain perceived as somewhat less foreign (Billé 2012).Frequently described by Chinese nationalists as regions that have broken away see Zhang-, these are liminal regions, not currently under Chinese control but with strong cultural and historic ties to China see Nelson .
