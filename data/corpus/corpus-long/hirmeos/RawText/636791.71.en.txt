There is a further point to be made in favour of physicalism(8). So far, every theoretical advance in physics has revealed that theories accepted earlier are false. Thus Galileo's laws of terrestrial motion and Kepler's laws of planetary motion are contradicted by Newtonian theory, in turn contradicted by special relativity, in turn contradicted by general relativity. The whole of classical physics is contradicted by quantum theory, in turn contradicted by quantum field theory. Science advances from one false theory to another. Viewed from a standard empiricist perspective, this seems discouraging, and has prompted the view that all future theories will be false as well, a view that has been called "the pessimistic induction". Viewed from the perspective of science presupposing physicalism(8), however, this mode of advance is wholly encouraging, since it is required if physicalism(8) is true. Granted physicalism(8), the only way a dynamical theory can be precisely true of any restricted range of phenomena is if it is such as to be straightforwardly generalizable so as to be true of all phenomena. Any physical theory inherently restricted to a limited range of phenomena, even though containing a wealth of true approximate predictions about these phenomena, must nevertheless be strictly false: only a theory of everything can be a candidate for truth! Not only does the way physics has advanced from one false theory to the next accord with physicalism(8); the conception of unity sketched in section 5.3 successfully accounts for another feature of the way theoretical physics has advanced. Let T 1 , T 2 , … T n stand for successive stages in the totality of fundamental theory in physics. Each of T 1 , T 2 , … T n contradicts physicalism, in that each of T 1 etc. asserts that nature is disunified, whereas physicalism(8) asserts that it is unified. This might seem to make a nonsense of the idea that T 1 , T 2 , … T n is moving steadily and progressively towards some future T n+r which is a precise, testable version of physicalism

. But what section 5.3 shows is that, even though all of T 1 , T 2 , … T n are incompatible with physicalism(8), because they are disunified, nevertheless a precise meaning can be given to the assertion that T r+1 is closer to physicalism, or more unified, than T r. This is the case if T r+1 is (a) of greater empirical content than T r (since these are candidate theories of everything), and (b) of a higher degree of unity than T r in ways specified in section 5.3. Thus the account of unity given above, involving physicalism(1-8), gives precision to the idea that a succession of false theories, T 1, … T n , all of which contradict physicalism(8), nevertheless can be construed as moving ever closer to the goal of specifying physicalism(8) as a precise, testable, physical theory of everything.

5.6 Metaphysical minimalism

I turn now to the argument designed to show that that version of physicalism should be accepted which is the weakest available which just suffices to exclude theories more disunified than currently accepted physical theories-at present the standard model (SM) and general relativity (GR). We may take this to be the strongest version of physicalism that is compatible with SM+GR. This, it may be argued, leads to physicalism(n = 3) being accepted-or possibly physicalism(n = 4, N = 4), where N = 4 does justice to the fact that SM+GR includes four distinct forces, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces, and gravitation (electromagnetism and the weak force being only partially unified in quantum electroweak theory).

But physicalism(n = 3) is, it may be argued, much too strong. It assumes that SM+GR is consistent. Quantum field theory ordinarily assumes flat Minkowskian space-time, but it can be extended to apply in the curved space-time of GR. Problems arise, however, when attempts are made to treat quantum mechanically described matter or energy as the source of gravitation, and so of the curvature of space-time, according to GR. No version of SM+GR can be applied satisfactorily to the interior of black holes. Insuperable problems arise if one tries to incorporate the quantum measurement of orthodox quantum theory into the framework of GR. SM+GR is, it seems, not a consistent theory. Even GR on its own faces a problem of consistency, in that GR predicts that a singularity forms inside a black hole, which constitutes a breakdown of the continuity of space-time, and thus a kind of inconsistency of the theory. In order to assess the degree of disunity of SM+GR one has to consider a version patched up in an ad hoc way so as to create a theory that is at least consistent. Such an ad hoc patching up will further increase the kind and degree of disunity of the theory.
