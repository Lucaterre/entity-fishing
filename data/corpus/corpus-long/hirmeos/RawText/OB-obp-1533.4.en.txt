On averagee, in the s and s, the catching of [mandarin fish] was probably a sporadic occurrence…up to a quarter of the fish caught with floating nets were mandarin fish. However, because of the ban on catching them, the mandarin fish caught by fishermen for personal consumption and through commercial fishing was not included in statistics… In our assessment, the effectiveness of all these prohibitions is very low… when there were indeed very few until the mid s, fishermen did not release the zheltoschyok [Elopichthys bambusa] they caught it seemed silly to release fish that was dead or half-dead). In addition, it is impossible to follow every single fisherman, and zheltoschyok is considered a delicacy by many residents of the "mur. Since during the Soviet period it was difficult to sell red book species' officially, the zheltoschyok caught by fishing companies ended up in the homes of fishermen Novomodnyi, Zolotukhin and Sharov .

Pilfering was just one form of the informal economy of Soviet times. Fish brought home (as well as any other commodity) became the subject of monetary and non-monetary forms of exchange. However, emerging informal practices became fixed over time, and changes in formal rules (e.g. transition to the market) just created a terrain for its transformation. Indeed, during the economic collapse, when Far Eastern fishermen as well as other workers did not receive their salaries for several months, a survival mechanism emerged on its own. As a result of this and other reasons, various informal and illegal practices consolidated, were becoming a tradition.

The "mur fish resources were dealt with in a traditionall manner,

i.e. they were exploited highly intensively both on the Russian and Chinese territories. As a result of official and unofficial fishing, stocks showed continual decline and by , no longer reached tons see

Here, the consensus among researchers is that China has consistently used rivers' biological resources more actively than Russia, due to the vast population living on Chinese territories:

As is well-known, in China's Heilongjiang Province, in areas adjacent to the Amur, fishing and fish farming constitute some of the key industries. Further, in the second half of the 20th century, and especially in the past two decades, the province's population has grown significantly. Under the impact of intensive fishing and environmental changes, sturgeon, salmon and several other species of fish have gradually disappeared from the Songhua River. The number of sturgeons in the upper and middle Amur have also decreased significantly. In the mid-s, a strategy was adopted in the province to expand the fish farming sector as an alternative to fishing, and by the fishing industry already represented just % of the total fish production in the region over thousand tons Novomodnyi, Zolotukhin and Sharov .

Despite the greater activity of Chinese fishermen, their activities on their bank of the river are, as a rule, mostly circumscribed to the realm of formal regulations. Levels of poaching in China are significantly lower than in Russia.

(Lyapustin, Pervushina and Fomenko 2010). In Russia, illegal catches exceed official ones, and the volume of poaching, particularly the illegal fishing of sturgeon, is constantly on the increase. Research on the informal economy is always confronted with the task of evaluating its volume in absolute and/ or relative terms. According to Amurrybvod's data, poaching in the Amur River exceeds legal activities by a factor of two-three (Khabarovskyi krai . These estimates are probably inaccurate. The official catch of chum salmon in the "mur was less than a thousand tonnes in , but according to the methodically justified estimates of Pacific Scientific Research Fisheries Centre PSRFCC specialists Novomodnyi, Zolotukhin and Sharov the consumptive catch of autumnal salmon in the area of the Amur, a length of ,,,, km, amounted to about nine tonnes in. In other words, the discrepancy is already nine times wider, but to this must be added the illegal trafficking of sturgeon, including caviar, as well as other fish (mandarin fish, zheltoschyok, catfish, etc.). According to PSRFC's conservative estimates, the illegal catch, just for sturgeon and only in the main part of the river, was not less than tonnes in. Thus, the excess of informal trafficking of fish over formal activities is to be multiplied by at least ten.

Extralegal fishing practices along the Russian riverbank include:

•• fishing without documentation for personal consumption, including prohibited species, through prohibited means, etc.;

•• use and appropriation of unlimited fishing rights for industrial aims by representatives of indigenous and minority peoples; •• small-enterprise catch by unregistered groups;

•• bribery of people in charge, procuring extralegal fishing;

•• non-observance of the border regime, creation of networks in
