, where championships were organised in summer and in winter respectively (ibid.). It is reported that at some point a cantilevered wheel was even erected, on which the city and its surroundings could be observed from above (Shimamura, personal communication).

Buryat families who used to live in nearby towns such as Dashbalbar in the north-began to settle around the city. According to former residents, by , when the uranium production stopped, about households lived in a separate district. After three years of uncertainty concerning the future of the mine and various attempts to restart production, Russian workers were given leave in , and returned home.

Once emptied of its inhabitants, the city became available for a completely different purpose: as the iron was removed by Mongols settlers and sold at the border to Chinese wholesale dealers, it became a stockpile of saleable parts. Ironically, the mining town itself suddenly transformed into a mine. Everything was removed: all metallic items of course, but also the iron components in buildings, leaving them standing without structure, as well as the metallic framework of the roads Figs. and. Pipes were extracted from the ground for the lead they contained and wires were pulled out for their copper.

After the Russian population left, only a few households specialised in iron removal remained in Mardai, occupying more central places in the town, while the rest of the households moved out. Today, a dozen households still live there, often on a seasonal basis, and continue collecting iron to sell it across the Chinese border Figs. and. "ccording to the people interviewed on site, they trade the iron they collect to brokers who then resell it to Chinese buyers, making quite significant profits in the process. Rumour has it that some very wealthy people made their fortune this way at the end of the s. The Mongolian state itself took on some scraping of its own, notably availing itself of railway tracks around Mardai to be reused for its own network.

Memories of Mardai-a forbidden island of modernity

Mongolian people who have known Mardai before its destruction remember it with great excitement, almost enthusiasm. This excitement, in part, comes from the fact that the city had been inaccessible for so long, and that it was brought down to ruins as soon as it became open to the public. This has allowed Mardai to remain some kind of a legend, mostly known by hearsay and clad with the prestige of lost Soviet grandeur; people's memories, intertwined with fantasies, single out Mardai as an archetype of Socialist modernity. How do people go about remembering something they have never seen? asked Morten Pedersen upon considering narratives of Buddhist temples in Mongolia's northern Darhad region. Following Lars Højer , Pedersen emphasised the peculiar enhancement of occult agency that sometimes grows out of having incurred a religious loss . He described how the leveling of almost every monastery in the Darhad region spurred people's imagination about the extent and power of Darhad Buddhism. Focusing on the fate of one single artefact, a golden Tara statue extracted from a monastery before it was destroyed during the purges of the s, Pedersen described the legends that flourished in relation to it. The statue, a condensation of Darhad "uddhism is now the material anchor point of a virtual templee that people carry in their mind ibid.. .

As we will see, the ruins of Mardai could be said to achieve the same kind of effect: a condensation of Socialist ideology and Soviet way of life, they form the material basis of a virtual temple to modernity. What follows confirms what emerges from Pedersen's material, and what has been proposed by anthropologists working on mnemonic techniques (e.g. Severi it is not so much absence that stimulates recollection as the salience 2 of the last remaining item. The last remnant spurs imagination and memory, irresistibly filling the void and conjuring up an invisible framework within which the isolated vestige starts making sense again. When I went to visit Mardai on a day trip in summer , I was lucky enough to meet Tögsöö. Now in his thirties, he was a teenager when the town partially opened in the beginning of the s. He often visited his brother, who had settled there with his family, and worked with him during the summer in small jobs related to the Russian population of the town selling milk to them, for examplee. "fter , when the Russians left, he took an active part in the iron trade.
